# The `postinstall: prisma generate` script (added so a plain `npm ci` leaves a
# usable client — Prisma 7 dropped its own install hook) runs as part of
# `npm ci`, and it needs the schema and config to exist. Copying just those two
# files rather than the whole `prisma/` directory keeps this layer cached when
# migrations or seed data change, which is most of the time.
#
# `prisma generate` needs no DATABASE_URL here: the datasource block in
# schema.prisma carries only `provider`, and the connection string reaches
# Prisma at runtime through the driver adapter (src/lib/db.ts).
