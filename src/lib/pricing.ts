// All money math happens in integer cents via exact decimal-fraction
// arithmetic (BigInt numerator/denominator, never floating-point

/**
 * Computes every derived total for a document from its items, extra lines,
 * discounts and tax rate. Rules:
 *
 * - Per item: base = unitPrice + Σ(line.qty * line.unitPrice); the item's
 *   discount (a mode + value, default "no discount" when the value is null —
 *   see `discountCents`) is resolved to cents and subtracted from base →
 *   itemTotal. The discount's percentage (the typed value itself for
 *   PERCENT, or the resolved cash amount converted back to a percentage of
 *   base for AMOUNT — see `capPct`) is compared against the item's cap
 *   (maxDiscountPct, default 100 = no cap); if it exceeds the cap, a
 *   violation is reported — the cap is NOT auto-applied, the math still uses
 *   the requested discount. Callers decide whether to reject the save when
 *   violations are present.
 *
 *   A NO-COMMISSION LINE TAKES NO DISCOUNT (director's ruling: a line that
 *   earns the business no commission earns it no discount either, "because
 *   we don't make money on such items"). Concretely, the item's own
 *   discount is resolved against a *narrower* base than plain `unitPrice +
 *   Σlines` — every line flagged `isNoCommission`, and the item's own
 *   unitPrice if the ITEM itself is flagged (`EngineItem.isNoCommission`),
 *   is carved out of that base first; the discount (whatever `discountValue`
 *   asks for) is computed and subtracted from what's left, and the carved-out
 *   portion passes through to `itemTotal` completely untouched. A wholly
 *   no-commission item ends up with a base of 0, so its discount silently
 *   resolves to 0 no matter what `discountValue` says — "no discount is
 *   applied", full stop; no violation is reported in that case either (see
 *   the commission section below and the inline comment at the check itself
 *   for why). A HAND-SET `unitPrice` is a completely different mechanism
 *   (see `EngineItem.isNoCommission`'s doc comment) and is never affected by
 *   any of this — a salesperson can still price a no-commission line down to
 *   $0 by hand, same as any other line.
 * - grossSubtotal = Σ item bases + Σ(extraLine.qty * extraLine.unitPrice),
 *   before any discounts.
 * - subtotal = Σ itemTotals + Σ(extraLine.qty * extraLine.unitPrice).
 * - The document-level discount (same mode + value shape, default "no
 *   discount") gets the identical no-commission carve-out one level up: it is
 *   resolved against `subtotal` minus the raw charged amount of every
 *   no-commission item/line across the whole document (not just this one
 *   item's own no-commission lines) — see the commission section below for
 *   where that running total is accumulated — and subtracted from `subtotal`
 *   → taxableBase. discountAmount = subtotal - taxableBase. A no-commission
 *   line's charged price is therefore identical before and after the
 *   document-level discount is applied — the customer pays its full charged
 *   price regardless of how deep a document discount cuts everything else.
 *   A DISCOUNT MUST NOT ERODE A TRADE-IN: the same base is ALSO widened back
 *   out by every credit item's magnitude (`creditItemsAbsCents`) before the
 *   discount is resolved — see the inline comment at `documentDiscountBaseCents`
 *   below for the worked example of why, left unwidened, a document discount
 *   would silently come partly out of the trade-in credit instead of
 *   entirely out of what the customer owes.
 * - taxAmount = taxableBase * taxRate/100.
 * - total = taxableBase + taxAmount.
 *
 * All arithmetic happens in integer cents internally (see toCents/fromCents
 * and the fraction helpers above); the returned totals are back in currency
 * units.
 *
 * Alongside all of that, `documentConcession` (see its own doc comment on
 * `DocumentConcession`) is accumulated in the same pass:
 *
 *   concession = Σ over items and option lines of (listPrice − unitPrice) × qty   // signed, see below
 *              + Σ item discount amounts
 *              + Σ |negative extra lines|
 *              + document discount amount
 *
 *   listValue  = Σ over items and option lines of listPrice × qty
 *              + Σ positive extra lines
 *
 * The `(listPrice − unitPrice)` term is signed ON PURPOSE — do not "simplify"
 * it to `Math.max(0, listPrice - unitPrice)`. A price *raised* above list
 * (John: "you can increase the price of the machine by $10,000 and then give
 * away $10,000 worth of options — we do that all the time") must contribute a
 * *negative* concession, so that maneuver nets to zero instead of being
 * counted as a $10,000 discount on top of the $10,000 given away in options.
 * Clamping to zero would silently double the apparent concession every time
 * a salesperson uses exactly the workflow this feature exists to support.
 *
 * A negative extra line is one mechanism for entering a trade-in (see
 * `customLineSchema`), and a trade-in allowance is money given away just
 * like a discount — so its absolute value counts toward `concession` too,
 * added on top of (not instead of) the listPrice/unitPrice term above, which
 * never runs over extra lines at all (`EngineExtraLine` has no `listPrice` —
 * a custom line has no catalogue price to concede against).
 *
 * A credit item (`EngineItem.isCredit` — the TRADE-IN catalogue product,
 * today) is the OTHER mechanism, and is folded into the SAME `tradeIns`
 * bucket rather than a third one: its full magnitude (`unitPrice` + any
 * option lines, after its own discount if any — see the items/lines loop
 * below) is added to `tradeIns`, exactly as a negative extra line's absolute
 * value already is. This is what "replacing, not duplicating, the
 * negative-extra-line handling" means in practice — a salesperson uses one
 * mechanism or the other for a given trade-in, never both, so nothing here
 * forces that; it just makes sure a credit item's own contribution is never
 * ALSO picked up by the listPrice/unitPrice `priceAdjustments` term or by
 * `itemDiscounts` — a credit item is excluded from both of those (its
 * `(listPrice − unitPrice)` term is skipped, and its own item discount, if
 * any, is folded into its `tradeIns` magnitude instead of into
 * `itemDiscounts`) precisely so its money is counted once, not twice. A
 * credit item's `listPrice` also never adds to `listValue` (the cap's
 * denominator), matching how a negative extra line's amount doesn't either —
 * only what was actually "sold" (kept as a charge, not given back) counts
 * toward the denominator.
 *
 * A credit item contributes `-(unitPrice + options)` (after its own
 * discount) to `subtotal` itself, via its entry in the returned
 * `itemTotals` — this is what makes it actually reduce the quote, not just
 * something `documentConcession` reports on the side.
 *
 * `listPrice: null` (a custom/legacy line with no catalogue price recorded)
 * is treated as equal to `unitPrice` — zero concession, and its value still
 * counts toward `listValue` at whatever `unitPrice` actually is.

  // document whose no-commission lines' list value alone exceeds what's left
  // of `taxableBase` reads as "no commission", never a negative number.
  //
  // Worked example (the one this was checked against, to the cent):
  // 4 commissionable items totalling $48,000, plus one $6,000-list
  // no-commission item hand-priced at whatever it's charged; 10% document
  // discount. Commissionable base 48,000 × 90% = 43,200 = the customer's
  // charge for those four items; the no-commission item's own charged price
  // passes through untouched (Commit 1) on top of that. Commission base is
  // NOT "taxableBase minus what the no-commission item was charged" — it is
  // `taxableBase − 6,000` (its LIST price) regardless of what it was
  // actually sold for. At the 4.5% tier that 43,200 base lands in, commission
  // is 43,200 × 4.5% = $1,944.00.

 * src/lib/validation/finalize.ts), so it lives here rather than in either of

 * `ConcessionCapBadge`/`ConcessionCapToast`). Pulls in `formatMoney` from
 * src/lib/format.ts — a plain, dependency-free formatter, so this stays safe
 * to import from a `@/lib/db`-free unit test the same as the rest of this
 * module — purely for that reason, despite this file's usual "no formatting
 * concerns" framing.
 *
 * A single opaque total ("Total concessions of $30,448.20...") gives the
 * reader no way to tell a real discount from, say, a trade-in entered as a
 * negative extra line — the owner saw exactly that next to a Summary panel
 * reading "Discount −$10,448.20" and reasonably concluded the bigger number
 * was wrong. It wasn't: the gap was a trade-in, which counts against the cap
 * by design (see `computeTotals`'s doc comment) but was invisible in the old
 * message. This names every non-zero part instead, e.g.:
 *
 *   "Concessions total $30,448.20 (10.12% of list price) — $10,448.20
 *   discount plus a $20,000.00 trade-in — above the 10% limit for
 *   Australia."
 *
 * `documentDiscount` and `itemDiscounts` are folded into one "discount"
 * figure — together they're exactly the number the Summary panel's own
 * "Discount" line already shows (see `DocumentForBuilder.summaryDiscountAmount`),
 * so naming them separately here would only reintroduce a second way to
 * read "discount" that disagrees with the one already on screen.
 * `priceAdjustments` (manual per-unit prices cut below list, outside the
 * discount fields entirely) gets its own phrase when positive; when
 * negative — prices raised above list — it is never described as a
 * discount (a reader must not be told a price *increase* gave money away):
 * it's named as a separate reduction instead, e.g. "...trade-in, less
 * $2,000.00 from a price increase above list — above...". A part that's
 * exactly zero is omitted entirely, so a document with only a discount (no
 * trade-in, no manual price cut) still gets a clean one-clause message.
