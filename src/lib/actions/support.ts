/**
 * Handles a PathQuote Support submission (Settings -> PathQuote Support,
 * open to any signed-in user — see src/lib/settings-nav.ts). The app
 * already knows who's asking, their role, and their region, so the form
 * only ever collects a subject and a message; everything else attached
 * below is context the sender never has to type.
 *
 * Order matters here and is deliberate:
 *   1. Validate the form fields.
 *   2. Resolve recipients (`resolveSupportRecipients`) *before* writing
 *      anything — if nobody holds the DEVELOPER role, this refuses plainly
 *      and stores nothing, rather than accepting a report that can never
 *      reach anyone.
 *   3. Store the message. This happens before the email send is attempted,
 *      not after — a misconfigured SMTP transport (a real, documented risk
 *      here — see docs/email-sending-setup.md) must never mean the report
 *      simply vanishes. `emailedAt`/`emailError` are filled in afterwards.
 *   4. Attempt the email, via the exact transport auth.ts's magic-link flow
 *      already uses (see src/lib/email/transport.ts). A failure here is
 *      recorded on the row and returned as a `warning`, not an `error` —
 *      the report itself was not lost, only the notification.
