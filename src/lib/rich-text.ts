// Pure helpers for the WYSIWYG rich-text editor (RichTextEditor, Tiptap) and
// its HTML-content-storage story. `ContentBlock.body` and `Document.notes`
// used to be markdown, hand-typed into a textarea (see src/lib/markdown.ts /
// src/lib/markdown-editor.ts, still kept around — see their own doc
// comments). Rows written by the WYSIWYG editor store Tiptap's HTML output
// instead, so every reader of stored content now has to handle BOTH shapes:
// old rows are still markdown, new rows (and any row an admin re-saves) are
// HTML. This module is that seam: `isHtmlContent` tells the two shapes
// apart, `toEditorHtml` normalizes either shape to HTML for loading INTO the
// editor, `sanitizeRichText` allowlist-sanitizes untrusted-ish editor HTML
// before it's ever stored or rendered, and `renderStoredRichText` is the one
// function every sheet/renderer should call on a stored body/notes value
// instead of `renderMarkdown` directly.
//
// No `@/lib/db` or `next/*` imports — same discipline as markdown.ts — so a
// plain `vitest run` of this file never needs `DATABASE_URL` set.
