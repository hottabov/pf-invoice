// --- option/product compatibility ------------------------------------------

/**
 * The `OptionCompatibility` OR-filter for "is this option compatible with
 * this item": an `Option` counts as compatible when it has a compat row at
 * *either* the series level (`seriesId` matches the item's product's series)
 * *or* the product level (`productId` matches the item's product itself) —
 * see the `OptionCompatibility` model, which allows both kinds of row
 * side-by-side (e.g. EasyLoader accessories are product-level, compatible
 * only with EL-2020, while most options are series-level).
 *
 * Pure and DB-agnostic so it's unit-testable without a database: shared by
 * `listCompatibleOptions` (queries/documents.ts, building the options list
 * shown in the builder) and `setItemOptions` (actions/documents.ts,
 * re-validating a submitted selection server-side).
 *
 * Returns `null` when neither id is available — a caller should treat that
 * as "no compatible options" (an empty `OR: []` would need per-ORM handling
 * to mean "match nothing," so callers short-circuit on `null` instead of
 * relying on that).

/**
 * Why an option in the item options editor is disabled, or `null` when it's
 * selectable. Two independent reasons, checked in this order:
 *
 * 1. `unpriced` — no usable price for the document's region (no `Price` row
 *    at all, or one flagged `needsReview`). The quote literally cannot be
 *    priced without one.
 * 2. `conflict` — a specific *other* option, already selected on this item,
 *    that shares an `OptionConflictGroup` with this one (e.g. a knife too
 *    long for the machine's cut height — see that model's comment in
 *    schema.prisma). Carries that option's code/name plus the shared
 *    group's name so the UI can name both ("Conflicts with DRG-1 — knife
 *    tools, fit one only"), not just say "disabled".
 *
 * `unpriced` wins when both apply — an option with no price is disabled for
 * its own reason regardless of what else is selected.
 *
 * Originally took only `price` (a deliberate narrowing — an earlier change
 * wrongly let *compatibility* disable an option here, which this signature
 * was written to make impossible: `listCompatibleOptions` is the only thing
 * allowed to keep an incompatible option out of the list entirely). A
 * conflict is a different, legitimate kind of "can't have both", so it's
 * added as an explicit second parameter rather than smuggled in — the
 * caller decides what counts as "already selected" (see
 * `ItemOptionsEditor`, which deliberately never treats the option currently
 * being toggled as its own conflict source, so deselecting the option that
 * caused a conflict re-enables the others on the very next render, no
 * server round trip).

 * whether two *submitted* options share a group, not who else is in it.
 *
 * An option with no membership row at all, or whose every group has no
 * other member among the given rows, has no entry (or an empty set) in the
 * result -- both mean "conflicts with nothing", the same contract
 * `findConflictingSelection` already expects from a missing map entry.
