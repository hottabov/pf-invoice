// Pure finalize-eligibility check, split out of src/lib/actions/finalize.ts

// `next/*` imports (importing `@/lib/db` eagerly constructs a Prisma client
// against `DATABASE_URL`, which isn't set — and shouldn't need to be — for
// a plain `vitest run` of pure logic; see tests/finalize-validation.test.ts).
// `EngineViolation` is a plain type from the dependency-free pricing engine
// (src/lib/pricing.ts).

/** The minimal shape `validateFinalizable` needs — deliberately not typed
 * against Prisma's generated `Document` payload so this stays trivial to
 * unit test with hand-built fixtures. `lines` is expected to already be
 * narrowed to document-level lines the way `finalizeDocument` loads them
 * (`lines: { where: { itemId: null } }`) — but the `itemId` check is still
 * applied here defensively in case a caller passes an unfiltered list. */

  companyId: string | null;
  items: unknown[];
  lines: { itemId: string | null }[];
};

/** The roles that can ever call `finalizeDocument` — kept as a local
 * string-literal union rather than importing Prisma's generated `Role` enum,
 * for the same "no `@/lib/db`-adjacent import" reason as everything else in
 * this file (the enum itself has no runtime/env dependency, but there's no
 * need to couple this pure module to `@prisma/client` either). DEVELOPER
 * carries the same finalize rights as ADMIN — see `isAdminRole`. */

/**
 * Returns a human-readable reason the document can't be finalized, or
 * `null` when it's ready. Checked in this order so a caller only ever sees
 * one actionable message at a time:
 *   1. no client selected yet;
 *   2. nothing to bill — zero items AND zero document-level lines;
 *   3. the pricing engine flagged a discount above its region cap (an item
 *      discount can end up violating its cap after the fact if an admin
 *      lowers `Region.maxDiscountPct` later — see the NOTE on
 *      `recalcDocument` in src/lib/actions/documents.ts — so this must be
 *      re-checked at finalize time, not just at save time) — but ONLY for a
 *      MANAGER. An ADMIN may finalize over a discount-cap violation (they
 *      can already set an over-cap item discount in the first place — see
 *      `setItemDiscount` — so blocking them again at finalize time would
 *      just be a second copy of a rule that's already role-gated upstream);
 *      the caller (`finalizeDocument`) is responsible for logging that an
 *      admin overrode a violation.
 *   4. the whole-document `documentConcession` (see its own doc comment on
 *      `PricingTotals` in src/lib/pricing.ts) exceeds the region cap — same
 *      re-check-at-finalize-time reasoning as #3 (a cap can be lowered after
 *      a manual price was saved), and same MANAGER-blocked/ADMIN-allowed
 *      split. This is the finalize-time half of closing Ross's hole: without
 *      it, a MANAGER could still get an over-cap manually-priced document
 *      *saved* as a draft (blocked at every mutating action — see
 *      `recalcAndEnforce`, src/lib/actions/documents.ts) but never actually
 *      finalized only by luck of ordering; checking it here too means
 *      finalize refuses on its own even if some future save path ever
 *      forgets to.
