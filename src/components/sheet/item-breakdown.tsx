/**
 * The one place the base/options/discount/subtotal idea is expressed (see
 * `ItemBreakdown`'s doc comment in src/lib/sheet-data.ts for the bug this
 * fixes) — used by `quotation-sheet.tsx` (the only customer-facing
 * document renderer left — the plain "Summary" sheet this component used
 * to also serve was removed), rendering a run of `<tr>`s inside the
 * caller's own `.pq-item-group` `<tbody>`. Only `code` is taken as a label
 * — the item's own name/description/thumbnail stay hand-rolled in the
 * caller's own header row, since those aren't part of the money breakdown
 * this component owns.
 *
 * This component's whole markup is posted to Gotenberg as a raw HTML string
 * (see quotation-sheet.tsx's own doc comment), so it — and everything it
 * imports — must stay free of `"use client"`, Tailwind, and event handlers.
 * The builder used to reuse this same component (a now-removed `"compact"`
 * variant) to show the same base/options/discount/subtotal list on its item
 * cards; it now has its own copy instead
 * (`src/components/builder/item-breakdown-editor.tsx`), because that copy
 * needs exactly the things this file may never have — client-side state and
 * click handlers, to make each price editable in place.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - The base price row renders labelled with `code`, with a bare quantity
 *   (`breakdown.qty` — always 1 today, a product line is always one machine)
 *   in the same column shape the option rows use, so the machine reads as
 *   the first line of its own list rather than a differently formatted
 *   heading. The quantity renders regardless of `showPrices`; only the price
 *   itself is gated. The one exception is a product assembled from its own
 *   options (`breakdown.assembledFromOptions` — see its doc comment), where
 *   the row is dropped entirely: it would show a machine at $0 directly
 *   under a heading that already names that machine.
 * - Every option row always renders — `code`/name (as "`code` — `name`" when
 *   `code` is set, plain `name` otherwise, exactly this component's old
 *   hand-rolled `OptionRow` formatting), its own `description` underneath
 *   when set, and qty — regardless of `showPrices`. Its own price only
 *   renders when `showPrices` is on AND the option's `lineTotal` is
 *   non-null (already resolved by `buildItemBreakdown` from the
 *   `showOptionPrices` toggle, so this component never has to know the
 *   toggle itself — only whether `lineTotal` is null). The `showPrices`
 *   half of that check is a defense-in-depth backstop for the same "no
 *   money at all" rule below — in correct production data it's redundant (a
 *   `showOptionPrices`-off `lineTotal` is only ever null when
 *   `showItemPrices` is also off, since `showPrices` is `showItemPrices ||
 *   showOptionPrices`), but it keeps the component's own guarantee
 *   self-contained rather than trusting the caller never to hand it an
 *   inconsistent breakdown.
 * - The discount row renders only when `breakdown.discount` is set AND
 *   `showPrices` is on (a discount is pure money information — nothing
 *   useful to show about it with prices hidden).
 * - The subtotal row renders whenever the item has options AND `showPrices`
 *   is on — regardless of whether individual option prices are shown. This
 *   is what lets a salesperson hide option-level pricing
 *   (`showOptionPrices` off) while still showing an honest per-machine
 *   figure (`showItemPrices` on).
 * - When `showPrices` is false, no money renders anywhere in this
 *   component — the document total is still shown elsewhere, unaffected.
 * - A credit item's `basePrice`/`options[].lineTotal`/`subtotal` are already
 *   negative decimal strings by the time they reach here (see
 *   `buildItemBreakdown`) — the base-price row, an option row, and the
 *   subtotal row each independently get the same `.pq-negative` muted
 *   treatment a negative extra line already gets on both sheets (reusing
 *   `isNegativeAmount`, not a second mechanism), so a trade-in entered as a
 *   credit product reads the same "this is money coming off, not a charge"
 *   way a freeform negative extra line always has.
