 * 3471" achieves that only in the sense that a locked door achieves tidiness
 * — so the country is a picker (flag and dialling code, defaulted from the
 * company), and the national part is formatted as it is typed, in that
 * country's own convention. What reaches the server is always E.164, in a
 * hidden input under `name`, so nothing downstream has to know this field
 * exists.
 *
 * `google-libphonenumber` does the formatting and the validity check, but it
 * is ~570KB and this field appears on three screens, so it is imported
 * lazily on mount. Until it lands the field is a plain digits input that
 * still assembles a correct E.164 value from `DIAL_CODES` — nothing is
 * blocked, the digits simply are not grouped yet.
