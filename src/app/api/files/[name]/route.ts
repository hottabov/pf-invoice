 * Streams a previously-uploaded image back to any authenticated user
 * (managers need to see catalog images too, not just admins). The proxy's
 * matcher excludes image-extension paths from its own auth check, so this
 * route re-checks the session itself rather than relying on the proxy.
 *
 * An optional `?w=<width>` asks for a downscaled WebP *thumbnail* of a
 * raster upload instead of the original bytes — see src/lib/image-
 * derivatives.ts. Only the widths in `DERIVATIVE_WIDTHS` are honoured;
 * anything else (including an SVG, or a width whose derivative can't be
 * built) silently serves the original, so a caller never has to branch on
 * the stored file's format. Quotation sheets/PDFs deliberately request the
 * URL *without* `w`, because those go to print at full resolution.
