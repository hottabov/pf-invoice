# Production Order Forms Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Generate the Pathfinder workshop order forms (M-Series, EasyLoader, FabricPro) from a finalized quote as one print-ready PDF, one A4 page per form, with every derivable box already ticked.

**Architecture:** The original `.xlsx` order forms become committed templates. For each machine item in the quote we patch cells in a copy of its template — inline strings only, one zip entry touched — and convert it through the existing Gotenberg container's LibreOffice route, then merge the pages with Gotenberg's PDF-engines route. A declarative `FormSpec` per form holds every cell coordinate, so adding a form is one file plus one template. Sales-side choices the price list does not carry (screen side, knife size, voltage, drills) live in a new `DocumentItem.productionSpec` JSON column.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript, Prisma 7 + PostgreSQL, Zod 4, Vitest, Gotenberg 8 (Chromium + LibreOffice + PDF engines), `fflate` for zip.

**Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-09-01-production-order-forms-design.md`

## Read this first

**Task 0 was the gate and it has passed** (2026-09-01). The xlsx-template approach is confirmed: LibreOffice renders a patched template as one faithful A4 page. Task 0 now records that result and the three coordinate bugs it caught; read it, then start at Task 1.

**Codebase conventions you must follow** (they are already established; do not invent new ones):

- Zod schemas live in `src/lib/validation/<domain>.ts` and are unit-tested in `tests/<domain>-validation.test.ts`.
- Server actions live in `src/lib/actions/<domain>.ts`, start with `"use server"`, call `requireSession()`, validate every argument with `safeParse`, return `ActionResult` (`{ error?: string; warning?: string }`), and finish with `revalidatePath`.
- Read queries live in `src/lib/queries/<domain>.ts` and are scoped to the caller with the helpers in `src/lib/scope.ts`.
- Migrations are hand-written SQL in `prisma/migrations/<n>_<name>/migration.sql`, numbered sequentially, and open with a comment explaining *why* the change exists — read `prisma/migrations/8_company_delivery_address/migration.sql` for the house style before writing yours.
- Tests are Vitest, in `tests/*.test.ts`, importing source as `../src/lib/...`.
- Run tests with `npm test`, types with `npm run typecheck`, lint with `npm run lint`.

**Database access during development:** `docker compose up -d postgres gotenberg` then `npm run db:migrate`. Gotenberg must be running for tasks 9 and 14 onward; `GOTENBERG_URL=http://localhost:3001` is already in `.env`.

## File structure

**New — data and validation**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `prisma/migrations/10_industry_and_production_spec/migration.sql` | `Industry` table, `Company.industryId`, `DocumentItem.productionSpec` + `lineGroup` |
| `src/lib/validation/industries.ts` | `industryNameSchema` |
| `src/lib/validation/production-spec.ts` | Per-series `productionSpec` schemas, `requiredKeysFor`, `missingKeys` |
| `src/lib/queries/industries.ts` | `listIndustries`, `countCompaniesUsingIndustry` |
| `src/lib/actions/industries.ts` | `createIndustry`, `renameIndustry`, `setCompanyIndustry` |
| `src/lib/actions/production.ts` | `setProductionSpec`, `setItemLineGroup` |

**New — form engine.** Split by responsibility, not by layer: each file is independently testable and holds one idea.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/production-forms/cell-ref.ts` | `columnIndex`, `splitRef` — pure address arithmetic |
| `src/lib/production-forms/xlsx-patch.ts` | `patchSheetXml`, `patchWorkbook` — the only code that touches xlsx bytes |
| `src/lib/production-forms/types.ts` | `FormSpec`, `FormContext`, `FormItem` |
| `src/lib/production-forms/context.ts` | `buildFormContext` — Prisma document → plain context |
| `src/lib/production-forms/resolve.ts` | `resolveForm`, `planForms`, `missingRequirements`, `additionalItems` |
| `src/lib/production-forms/specs/m-series.ts` | M-Series cell map |
| `src/lib/production-forms/specs/easyloader.ts` | EasyLoader cell map |
| `src/lib/production-forms/specs/fabricpro.ts` | FabricPro cell map |
| `src/lib/production-forms/specs/index.ts` | `FORM_SPECS` registry |
| `src/lib/production-forms/render.ts` | `xlsxToPdf`, `mergePdfs` — Gotenberg calls |
| `src/lib/production-forms/templates/*.xlsx` | Committed template binaries |

**New — UI and route**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/components/clients/industry-picker.tsx` | Typeahead combobox with create + rename |
| `src/components/builder/production-spec-editor.tsx` | Per-item production fields + line chip |
| `src/components/documents/production-forms-section.tsx` | Readiness list + download buttons |
| `src/components/sheet/additional-items-sheet.tsx` | The "Additional items" page |
| `src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/production-forms/route.ts` | Merged PDF, `?item=` for one form |
| `scripts/import-industries.ts` | Bulk import |

**Modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | New model + three columns |
| `src/components/clients/company-form.tsx` | Mount `IndustryPicker` |
| `src/components/builder/items-list.tsx` | Mount `ProductionSpecEditor` in each machine card |
| `src/app/(app)/documents/[documentId]/page.tsx` | Mount `ProductionFormsSection` |
| `package.json` | Add `fflate` |

## Task 0: Spike — LibreOffice fidelity — **PASSED 2026-09-01, no work required**

This gate has already been run and cleared. It is recorded here so the result and its consequences are not lost.

**What was done:** `M-series order 12.xlsx` was patched with a full set of `X` marks and header values by a throwaway script and converted with headless LibreOffice — the same engine Gotenberg's `/forms/libreoffice/convert` route wraps.

**Result:** exactly one A4 page (595.3 × 841.9 pt), every `X` inside its intended box, logos, frames, print area and scaling intact. Century Gothic was substituted by the container's default sans, which the repo owner accepted. **Approach A stands. Approach B is not needed.**

**Three coordinate bugs it caught**, already corrected in the tasks below and in spec §5.1 — do not "fix" them back:

1. Writing the author name into `M8` clipped the `Name:` label to "Nam". The label lives in `L8`, which is 4.3 characters wide and depends on overflowing rightwards. The name belongs in `N8`.
2. `E81` does not exist in the sheet XML at all — Excel omits empty cells, so the patcher's cell-insert path is load-bearing, not theoretical. Drills moved to `H81` (Yes/No) and `J82` (detail).
3. Rows 81–82 carry a large hand-writing font and their two columns collide. Hence the caps: drill detail 22 characters, special notes 28 characters, notes on one line only.

**The generalisable lesson for every remaining form spec:** a cell that looks blank beside a label may be the cell that label overflows into, and a "free area" is only as wide as the next occupied cell. Neither is visible in the spreadsheet, and neither is catchable by the contract test in Task 15. **Every new form spec gets one page printed and checked by eye before it ships.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Read this task, change nothing, move to Task 1**

If you want to reproduce the render yourself before trusting it:

```bash
docker compose up -d gotenberg
curl -sS --request POST http://localhost:3001/forms/libreoffice/convert \
  --form files=@"RAW/Order Forms/M-series order 12.xlsx" -o /tmp/blank-form.pdf
pdfinfo /tmp/blank-form.pdf | grep Pages
```

Expected: `Pages: 1`. That confirms the container converts the template to a single A4 page before any patching is involved.

---

## Task 1: Schema and migration

**Files:**
- Modify: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Create: `prisma/migrations/10_industry_and_production_spec/migration.sql`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the model and columns to the schema**

In `prisma/schema.prisma`, add a new model after `Contact`:

```prisma
// Lookup table rather than free text on Company: the list is bulk-imported
// (scripts/import-industries.ts) and picked hundreds of times, so an
// industry has to be one row every company points at instead of a string
// repeated with drifting spellings -- that is what makes the inline rename
// in industry-picker.tsx a real fix rather than a per-company patch.
// Global, not per-region: an industry means the same thing in AU and US.
model Industry {
  id        String    @id @default(cuid())
  name      String    @unique
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  companies Company[]
}
```

In `model Company`, add beside the other optional fields:

```prisma
  industryId String?
  industry   Industry? @relation(fields: [industryId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
```

and add `@@index([industryId])` next to the existing `@@index([ownerId])`.

In `model DocumentItem`, add after `showImage`:

```prisma
  // Sales-side production choices the price list does not carry: screen side
  // (+Y/-Y), knife size, voltage, drills, EasyLoader table sections. Shape
  // varies by series -- validated by src/lib/validation/production-spec.ts,
  // never read as free-form JSON. Deliberately NOT covered by the finalize
  // lock: it carries no commercial meaning, so correcting a knife size must
  // not force an unfinalize/refinalize cycle that churns document numbering.
  productionSpec Json?
  // Production line grouping. Items sharing a value share an operator-screen
  // side -- a cutter, its EasyLoader and its FabricPro stand together and a
  // mismatched side is a physical installation fault. Defaults to 1 so the
  // single-line case never sees the field. See spec section 4.2 for why this
  // is an Int rather than a ProductionLine table.
  lineGroup      Int  @default(1)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the migration**

Create `prisma/migrations/10_industry_and_production_spec/migration.sql`:

```sql
-- Production order forms (docs/specs/2026-09-01-production-order-forms-design.md).
--
-- Industry becomes a lookup table because the list is bulk-imported and
-- shared: one row per industry that every company references, so fixing an
-- imported typo fixes it everywhere. ON DELETE SET NULL so removing an
-- industry never blocks and never cascades into companies.
--
-- DocumentItem gains the two fields the order forms need but the price list
-- has no reason to carry: productionSpec (screen side, knife size, voltage,
-- drills, table sections) and lineGroup, which keeps the operator-screen
-- side consistent across a cutter and its spreaders. lineGroup defaults to 1
-- so every existing item reads as "the only line" with no data migration.
CREATE TABLE "Industry" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "Industry_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "Industry_name_key" ON "Industry"("name");

ALTER TABLE "Company" ADD COLUMN "industryId" TEXT;

CREATE INDEX "Company_industryId_idx" ON "Company"("industryId");

ALTER TABLE "Company" ADD CONSTRAINT "Company_industryId_fkey"
    FOREIGN KEY ("industryId") REFERENCES "Industry"("id")
    ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE "DocumentItem" ADD COLUMN "productionSpec" JSONB,
ADD COLUMN "lineGroup" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Apply and verify**

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
npm run db:migrate
npx prisma generate
npm run typecheck
```

Expected: migration applies, `typecheck` passes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add prisma/schema.prisma prisma/migrations/10_industry_and_production_spec
git commit -m "feat: industry lookup table, production spec and line group on items"
```

## Task 2: Industry validation schema

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/validation/industries.ts`
- Test: `tests/industries-validation.test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/industries-validation.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { industryNameSchema, normalizeIndustryName } from "../src/lib/validation/industries";

describe("industryNameSchema", () => {
  it("accepts a normal name", () => {
    expect(industryNameSchema.safeParse("Automotive").success).toBe(true);
  });

  it("trims surrounding whitespace", () => {
    const result = industryNameSchema.safeParse("  Marine upholstery  ");
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    if (result.success) expect(result.data).toBe("Marine upholstery");
  });

  it("rejects an empty string", () => {
    expect(industryNameSchema.safeParse("").success).toBe(false);
  });

  it("rejects whitespace only", () => {
    expect(industryNameSchema.safeParse("   ").success).toBe(false);
  });

  it("rejects a name longer than 80 characters", () => {
    expect(industryNameSchema.safeParse("x".repeat(81)).success).toBe(false);
  });
});

describe("normalizeIndustryName", () => {
  it("lowercases for comparison", () => {
    expect(normalizeIndustryName("Automotive")).toBe("automotive");
  });

  it("collapses internal whitespace", () => {
    expect(normalizeIndustryName("Marine   upholstery")).toBe("marine upholstery");
  });

  it("treats differently cased spellings as the same key", () => {
    expect(normalizeIndustryName("AUTOMOTIVE")).toBe(normalizeIndustryName("automotive"));
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/industries-validation.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — cannot resolve `../src/lib/validation/industries`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/validation/industries.ts`:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

/**
 * An industry name as typed by a user. 80 characters is generous for the
 * imported list and keeps the value inside the `Industry:` cell on every
 * order form without overflow.
 */
export const industryNameSchema = z
  .string()
  .trim()
  .min(1, "Industry name is required")
  .max(80, "Industry name must be 80 characters or fewer");

/**
 * Comparison key for deduplication. Creating "automotive" when "Automotive"
 * already exists must select the existing row rather than add a near-
 * duplicate to a list people scroll through -- see `createIndustry`.
 */
export function normalizeIndustryName(name: string): string {
  return name.trim().replace(/\s+/g, " ").toLowerCase();
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/industries-validation.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, 8 tests.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/validation/industries.ts tests/industries-validation.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: industry name validation and dedup key"
```

## Task 3: Industry queries and actions

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/queries/industries.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/actions/industries.ts`

Read `src/lib/actions/clients.ts` first — copy its `requireSession` / `safeParse` / `ActionResult` / `revalidatePath` shape exactly.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the queries**

Create `src/lib/queries/industries.ts`:

```ts
import { db } from "@/lib/db";

/**
 * Every industry, alphabetically. The picker filters client-side: the list
 * is expected to hold hundreds of imported rows, which is small enough to
 * ship whole and makes typeahead instant with no round trip per keystroke.
 */
export async function listIndustries() {
  return db.industry.findMany({ orderBy: { name: "asc" } });
}

/**
 * How many companies point at an industry. Shown in the rename confirmation
 * so a shared-row edit is never silent.
 */
export async function countCompaniesUsingIndustry(industryId: string): Promise<number> {
  return db.company.count({ where: { industryId } });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the actions**

Create `src/lib/actions/industries.ts`:

```ts
"use server";

import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { Prisma } from "@prisma/client";
import type { z } from "zod";
import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import { requireAdmin, requireSession } from "@/lib/authz";
import { companyWhereForUser } from "@/lib/scope";
import { idSchema, optionalIdSchema } from "@/lib/validation/documents";
import { industryNameSchema, normalizeIndustryName } from "@/lib/validation/industries";

export type ActionResult = { error?: string };

const NOT_FOUND_ERROR = "Not found";

/** Join every zod issue message (form-level + field-level) into one string
 * for a plain `{ error }` result — same helper as actions/clients.ts, kept
 * local here for the same reason: one tiny function is not worth a
 * dependency between two action modules. */
function flattenZodError(error: z.ZodError): string {
  const flat = error.flatten();
  const messages = [...flat.formErrors, ...Object.values(flat.fieldErrors).flat()].filter(
    (m): m is string => Boolean(m)
  );
  return messages.length > 0 ? messages.join(" ") : "Invalid input";
}

/**
 * Finds an industry by case-insensitive name, or null.
 *
 * Prisma cannot express `WHERE LOWER(name) = $1` against the functional index
 * the migration creates, and `mode: "insensitive"` would not use it either.
 * The table holds hundreds of rows at most, so reading them and comparing in
 * JS is both correct and cheap.
 */
async function findByNormalizedName(name: string) {
  const key = normalizeIndustryName(name);
  return (await db.industry.findMany()).find((row) => normalizeIndustryName(row.name) === key) ?? null;
}

/**
 * Creates an industry, or returns the existing one when a case-insensitive
 * match is already present -- typing "automotive" next to an existing
 * "Automotive" must not grow the list by a near-duplicate.
 *
 * The pre-check alone is check-then-act and races: two people typing the same
 * industry into the picker at the same moment would both pass it. The
 * `Industry_name_lower_key` functional index in the migration is the real
 * guarantee, so a unique violation here is an expected outcome, not an error
 * -- it means someone else won, and their row is the answer.
 */
export async function createIndustry(name: string): Promise<ActionResult & { id?: string }> {
  await requireSession();

  const parsed = industryNameSchema.safeParse(name);
  if (!parsed.success) return { error: flattenZodError(parsed.error) };

  const existing = await findByNormalizedName(parsed.data);
  if (existing) return { id: existing.id };

  try {
    const created = await db.industry.create({ data: { name: parsed.data } });
    revalidatePath("/clients");
    return { id: created.id };
  } catch (error) {

    }
    throw error;
  }
}

/**
 * Renames the shared row. The caller shows the affected-company count first
 * (see `countCompaniesUsingIndustry`); this only guards the data.
 */
// Admin-only, unlike createIndustry: creating is additive and deduplicated,
// but renaming changes a value every manager's companies display and every
// production form prints. Same rule as the other global tables.

  await requireAdmin();

  const parsedId = idSchema.safeParse(industryId);

  try {
    await db.industry.update({ where: { id: industry.id }, data: { name: parsed.data } });
  } catch (error) {
    // Same race as createIndustry: another rename could have taken this name
    // between the check above and the write. Report it as the collision it is
    // rather than surfacing a raw database error.
    if (error instanceof Prisma.PrismaClientKnownRequestError && error.code === "P2002") {
      return { error: `"${parsed.data}" already exists` };
    }
    throw error;
  }

  revalidatePath("/clients");
  return {};
}

/**
 * Points a company at an industry, or clears it. Scoped like every other
 * company mutation in src/lib/actions/clients.ts.
 */
export async function setCompanyIndustry(
  companyId: string,
  industryId: string | null,
): Promise<ActionResult> {
  const session = await requireSession();

  const parsedCompanyId = idSchema.safeParse(companyId);
  if (!parsedCompanyId.success) return { error: NOT_FOUND_ERROR };

  const parsedIndustryId = optionalIdSchema.safeParse(industryId ?? undefined);
  if (!parsedIndustryId.success) return { error: NOT_FOUND_ERROR };

  const company = await db.company.findFirst({
    where: { id: parsedCompanyId.data, ...companyWhereForUser(session.user) },
  });
  if (!company) return { error: NOT_FOUND_ERROR };

  await db.company.update({
    where: { id: company.id },
    data: { industryId: parsedIndustryId.data ?? null },
  });

  revalidatePath(`/clients/${company.id}`);
  return {};
}
```

Note on the local helpers: every action module in this repo declares its own `ActionResult` and its own `flattenZodError`, each with a comment saying the duplication is deliberate rather than accidental. That is the established pattern — follow it. Do **not** try to import `flattenZodError` from `src/lib/actions/documents.ts`: it is not exported, and it cannot be, because a `"use server"` module may only export async server actions.

`companyWhereForUser` and `requireSession` do already exist and are shared — import them from `@/lib/scope` and `@/lib/authz` as shown.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify types**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS. Fix any import path that does not match what `clients.ts` actually exports.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/queries/industries.ts src/lib/actions/industries.ts
git commit -m "feat: industry queries and create/rename/assign actions"
```

## Task 4: Industry picker component

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/clients/industry-picker.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/clients/company-form.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the picker**

Create `src/components/clients/industry-picker.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useMemo, useState } from "react";
import { createIndustry, renameIndustry, setCompanyIndustry } from "@/lib/actions/industries";
import { normalizeIndustryName } from "@/lib/validation/industries";

type Industry = { id: string; name: string };

type Props = {
  companyId: string;
  industries: Industry[];
  selectedId: string | null;
  /** Companies using the currently selected industry, for the rename confirm. */
  usageCount: number;
  /**
   * Whether to offer the rename pencil. Renaming is admin-only (see

   * manager's companies. Creating and selecting stay open to everyone.
   */
  canRename: boolean;
};

          {canCreate && (
            <li>
              <button type="button" onClick={create} className="w-full px-2 py-1 text-left font-medium">
                Create &ldquo;{query.trim()}&rdquo;
              </button>
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      )}

      {error && <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Mount it in the company form**

In `src/components/clients/company-form.tsx`, extend the props and add a field row beside the other company fields, using the existing `FieldRow` from `@/components/ui-kit`:

```tsx
import { IndustryPicker } from "@/components/clients/industry-picker";

// added to the component's Props
type Props = {
  // ...existing props
  industries: Array<{ id: string; name: string }>;
  industryUsageCount: number;
};

// rendered among the existing field rows
<FieldRow label="Industry">
  <IndustryPicker
    companyId={company.id}
    industries={industries}
    selectedId={company.industryId}
    usageCount={industryUsageCount}
  />
</FieldRow>
```

In the server component that renders the form (`src/app/(app)/clients/[companyId]/page.tsx`), load and pass them:

```tsx
const industries = await listIndustries();
const industryUsageCount = company.industryId
  ? await countCompaniesUsingIndustry(company.industryId)
  : 0;
```

The picker writes through its own action rather than the surrounding form, so it only works on a saved company. On the "new client" screen (`src/app/(app)/clients/new/page.tsx`) do not render it — industry is set once the company exists.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify manually**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open a client card. Confirm: typing filters; a non-matching query offers `Create "…"`; creating selects it; the pencil renames with the company count in the prompt; `Clear` empties the field.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/clients/industry-picker.tsx src/components/clients/company-form.tsx
git commit -m "feat: industry picker with typeahead, inline create and rename"
```

## Task 5: Industry bulk import script

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/import-industries.ts`
- Modify: `package.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

Create `scripts/import-industries.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Bulk-imports industries from a newline-separated file. Upserts by
 * normalized name so re-running is safe and never creates a near-duplicate
 * of a row a user already added by hand through the picker.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/import-industries.ts industries.txt
 */
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { industryNameSchema, normalizeIndustryName } from "../src/lib/validation/industries";

async function main() {
  const path = process.argv[2];
  if (!path) {
    console.error("Usage: npx tsx scripts/import-industries.ts <file>");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  // Imported here, not at module scope. Prisma 7 in this project needs an
  // explicit driver adapter (see src/lib/db.ts); a bare `new PrismaClient()`
  // throws at module load, before the usage check above can run. Same lazy
  // import that scripts/create-user.ts and scripts/import-product-images.ts
  // use.
  const { db } = await import("../src/lib/db");

  const existing = await db.industry.findMany();
  const seen = new Map(existing.map((row) => [normalizeIndustryName(row.name), row.name]));

  let created = 0;
  let skipped = 0;
  let invalid = 0;

  for (const raw of readFileSync(path, "utf8").split("\n")) {
    if (!raw.trim()) continue;

    const parsed = industryNameSchema.safeParse(raw);
    if (!parsed.success) {
      console.warn(`skipping invalid name: ${JSON.stringify(raw)}`);
      invalid += 1;
      continue;
    }

    const key = normalizeIndustryName(parsed.data);
    if (seen.has(key)) {
      skipped += 1;
      continue;
    }

    await db.industry.create({ data: { name: parsed.data } });
    seen.set(key, parsed.data);
    created += 1;
  }

  console.log(`created ${created}, already present ${skipped}, invalid ${invalid}`);
}

main()
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(() => process.exit(0));
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the npm script**

In `package.json`, beside the other `scripts` entries:

```json
"import:industries": "tsx scripts/import-industries.ts",
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify**

```bash
printf 'Automotive\nMarine upholstery\nautomotive\n\n' > /tmp/industries.txt
npm run import:industries /tmp/industries.txt
npm run import:industries /tmp/industries.txt
```

Expected: first run reports `created 2`; second reports `created 0, already present 2`. The lowercase `automotive` is deduplicated against `Automotive` on the first run.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/import-industries.ts package.json
git commit -m "feat: bulk industry import script, upsert by normalized name"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-spec-validation.test.ts`

## Task 7: Production spec actions

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/actions/production.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the actions**

Create `src/lib/actions/production.ts`:

```ts

## Task 8: Cell reference arithmetic

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/cell-ref.ts`
- Test: `tests/cell-ref.test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/cell-ref.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { columnIndex, splitRef } from "../src/lib/production-forms/cell-ref";

describe("columnIndex", () => {
  it("maps A to 1", () => expect(columnIndex("A")).toBe(1));

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/cell-ref.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — module not found.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/cell-ref.ts`:

```ts

## Task 9: The xlsx patcher

This is the file that carries all of the fidelity risk. Read spec §7.1 before writing it.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/xlsx-patch.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/templates/m-series-order-12.xlsx`
- Test: `tests/xlsx-patch.test.ts`
- Modify: `package.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the zip dependency and commit the template**

```bash
npm install fflate
mkdir -p src/lib/production-forms/templates
cp "RAW/Order Forms/M-series order 12.xlsx" src/lib/production-forms/templates/m-series-order-12.xlsx

`fflate` is a dependency, not a devDependency — the route uses it at runtime.

## Task 10: Form types and the M-Series spec

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/types.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/specs/m-series.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/specs/index.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the types**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/types.ts`:

```ts
import type { z } from "zod";

/** One quote item, flattened for form rendering. */
export type FormItem = {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  name: string;
  lineGroup: number;
  spec: Record<string, unknown>;
  /** Option codes on this item, e.g. ["VRB-220", "MTS", "HFV-M"]. */
  optionCodes: string[];
  /** Attribute bags keyed by option code, e.g. { MTS: { metres: 14 } }. */
  optionAttributes: Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>;
};

/** Everything a form needs that is not the item itself. */
export type FormContext = {
  distributorName: string;
  authorName: string;
  company: { name: string; addressLines: string[]; industry: string | null };
  contact: { fullName: string; position: string | null; phone: string | null; email: string | null };
  deliveryAddressLines: string[];
  /** Document-level software product codes, e.g. ["PTW(I)", "ANT-V6"]. */
  softwareCodes: string[];
  item: FormItem;
};

export type FormSpec = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  template: string;
  /** Path of the worksheet inside the xlsx zip. */
  sheetPath: string;
  matches: (code: string) => boolean;
  /** Written into blank cells. */
  values: Array<{ cell: string; from: (ctx: FormContext) => string | number | null | undefined }>;
  /** Overwrites printed label text -- rare, and declared separately so it is visible. */
  replaces: Array<{ cell: string; from: (ctx: FormContext) => string | null | undefined }>;
  /**
   * `covers` names the option code pattern a tick consumes. It is what lets
   * the engine work out which of an item's options the form has no box for --
   * a tick's `when` alone cannot say that, and an option that silently
   * vanishes is the worst failure this feature could have. Ticks driven by
   * the product code or the production spec leave it undefined.
   */
  ticks: Array<{ cell: string; when: (ctx: FormContext) => boolean; covers?: RegExp }>;
  /** productionSpec keys that block generation while unanswered. */
  requires: string[];
  specSchema: z.ZodTypeAny;
};
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the M-Series spec**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/specs/m-series.ts`. Cell coordinates come from spec §5.1 — do not adjust them without re-reading the template.

```ts
import { mSeriesSpecSchema } from "@/lib/validation/production-spec";
import type { FormContext, FormSpec } from "../types";

const CODE = /^M(3|5|7|10)(180|220|300|390)$/;

/** Model and width are only recoverable from the code -- Product.specs is null for every row. */
function parseCode(code: string): { model: string; width: number } | null {
  const match = CODE.exec(code);
  if (!match) return null;
  return { model: `M${match[1]}`, width: Number(match[2]) };
}

const model = (want: string) => (ctx: FormContext) => parseCode(ctx.item.code)?.model === want;
const width = (want: number) => (ctx: FormContext) => parseCode(ctx.item.code)?.width === want;

/**
 * An option tick. Catalog codes carry series suffixes (ABR-M) while the form
 * prints base codes, so matching is by pattern. `covers` records the same
 * pattern so `unmatchedOptionCodes` can tell what this form has no box for.
 */
const optionTick = (cell: string, pattern: RegExp) => ({
  cell,
  when: (ctx: FormContext) => ctx.item.optionCodes.some((code) => pattern.test(code)),
  covers: pattern,
});

const spec = (key: string, want: string) => (ctx: FormContext) => ctx.item.spec[key] === want;

/**
 * PathWorks modules tick this form only when the quote carries the integrated
 * PathWorks. With the standalone one they belong on the Software Order Form
 * instead -- two different orders, not a duplication. See spec section 6.3.
 */
const integrated = (moduleCode: string) => (ctx: FormContext) =>
  ctx.softwareCodes.includes("PTW(I)") && ctx.softwareCodes.includes(moduleCode);

export const mSeriesSpec: FormSpec = {
  id: "m-series",

    { cell: "M73", from: (c) => c.item.optionAttributes["MTS"]?.metres as number | undefined },
    // Rows 81-82 are the tall hand-writing rows and carry a large font, so
    // very little fits and the drills and notes columns collide. Cells and
    // caps below are the ones measured in the spike -- do not widen them
    // without printing a page and looking at it.
    { cell: "H81", from: (c) => ((c.item.spec.drills as { required?: boolean })?.required ? "Yes" : "No") },

  ],

  replaces: [],

  ticks: [

    optionTick("F55", /^BCR/),
    optionTick("J55", /^DR2$/),
    optionTick("F57", /^IKA$/),
    optionTick("J57", /^AFP$/),

    { cell: "P50", when: spec("voltage", "220V") },
    { cell: "P52", when: spec("voltage", "400V") },
    { cell: "P55", when: spec("voltage", "415V") },
    { cell: "P57", when: spec("voltage", "480V") },

    { cell: "F62", when: integrated("PDG") },
    { cell: "J62", when: integrated("WPN") },
    { cell: "O62", when: integrated("WPL") },
    { cell: "F64", when: integrated("ANT-V5") },
    { cell: "J64", when: integrated("ANT-V6") },

    { cell: "F68", when: spec("knifeSize", "1.5x5.0") },
    { cell: "J68", when: spec("knifeSize", "1.5x7.0") },
    { cell: "O68", when: spec("knifeSize", "2.0x7.0") },

    optionTick("D72", /^MTS$/),
  ],
};
```

The voltage tick cells (`P50`/`P52`/`P55`/`P57`) sit in the right-hand options column beside the `220V`/`400V`/`415V`/`480V` labels — confirm each against the template during Task 15's contract test, and visually the first time a form with a voltage is printed.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the registry**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/specs/index.ts`:

```ts
import type { FormSpec } from "../types";
import { mSeriesSpec } from "./m-series";

/** Order is irrelevant: matching is by product code and pages follow item sortOrder. */
export const FORM_SPECS: FormSpec[] = [mSeriesSpec];
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify types**

Run: `npm run typecheck`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/production-forms/types.ts src/lib/production-forms/specs

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-forms-resolve.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, 17 tests.

If a test naming a specific cell fails, the coordinate in `m-series.ts` is wrong — check it against spec §5.1 and the template before changing the test.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/production-forms/resolve.ts tests/production-forms-resolve.test.ts

## Task 12: Build the form context from a document

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/context.ts`
- Test: `tests/production-forms-context.test.ts`

Read `src/lib/sheet-data.ts` first — `buildFormContext` follows the same shape: take the Prisma document the builder query already returns, and flatten it into plain data with no Prisma types leaking out.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/production-forms-context.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { buildFormContexts, companyAddressLines } from "../src/lib/production-forms/context";

const baseDocument = {
  id: "doc1",
  number: "Q-AU-2026-001",
  entitySnapshot: { entityName: "Pathfinder Australia Pty Ltd" },
  region: { entityName: "Pathfinder Australia Pty Ltd" },
  author: { name: "Vadym H" },
  company: {

      code: "M5220",
      name: "M-Series",
      lineGroup: 1,
      productionSpec: { ui: "+Y" },
      lines: [
        { kind: "OPTION", code: "MTS", name: "Machine Transfer System", qty: 1, attributes: { metres: 14 } },
        { kind: "OPTION", code: "ABR-M", name: "Air Brush", qty: 1, attributes: null },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: "item2",
      code: "PTW(I)",
      name: "PathWorks Integrated",
      lineGroup: 1,
      productionSpec: null,
      lines: [],
    },
  ],
  lines: [],
};

describe("companyAddressLines", () => {
  it("joins city, state and postcode onto one line", () => {
    expect(companyAddressLines(baseDocument.company)).toEqual([
      "12 Industrial Drive",
      "Dandenong South VIC 3175",
      "Australia",
    ]);
  });

  it("skips absent parts rather than leaving gaps", () => {
    const lines = companyAddressLines({ ...baseDocument.company, state: null, postcode: null });
    expect(lines).toEqual(["12 Industrial Drive", "Dandenong South", "Australia"]);
  });
});

describe("buildFormContexts", () => {
  it("builds one context per item that has a form", () => {
    const contexts = buildFormContexts(baseDocument as never);
    expect(contexts).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(contexts[0].item.code).toBe("M5220");
  });

  it("takes the distributor from the frozen entity snapshot", () => {
    expect(buildFormContexts(baseDocument as never)[0].distributorName).toBe(
      "Pathfinder Australia Pty Ltd",
    );
  });

  it("falls back to the live region entity when there is no snapshot", () => {
    const doc = { ...baseDocument, entitySnapshot: null };
    expect(buildFormContexts(doc as never)[0].distributorName).toBe("Pathfinder Australia Pty Ltd");
  });

  it("collects option codes and attributes onto the item", () => {

    expect(item.optionCodes).toEqual(["MTS", "ABR-M"]);
    expect(item.optionAttributes["MTS"]).toEqual({ metres: 14 });
  });

  it("exposes items without a form as software codes", () => {
    expect(buildFormContexts(baseDocument as never)[0].softwareCodes).toContain("PTW(I)");
  });

  it("reuses the main address as delivery when they are the same", () => {
    const ctx = buildFormContexts(baseDocument as never)[0];
    expect(ctx.deliveryAddressLines).toEqual(ctx.company.addressLines);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-forms-context.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — module not found.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/context.ts`:

```ts
import { displayCountry } from "@/lib/countries";
import { resolveForm } from "./resolve";
import type { FormContext, FormItem } from "./types";

type AddressLike = {
  street: string | null;
  city: string | null;
  state: string | null;
  postcode: string | null;
  country: string | null;
};

/**
 * Three lines, matching the three underlined address rows every form prints.
 * Absent parts are skipped rather than left as gaps, so a company with no
 * state does not print a stray double space.
 */
export function companyAddressLines(address: AddressLike): string[] {
  const locality = [address.city, address.state, address.postcode].filter(Boolean).join(" ");
  const country = address.country ? displayCountry(address.country) : null;
  return [address.street, locality || null, country].filter((line): line is string => Boolean(line));
}

/**
 * Flattens the document the builder query already returns into one context
 * per item that prints a form. Items with no form -- software, services --
 * do not get a context; their codes are exposed on every context as
 * `softwareCodes` so a form can ask whether PathWorks Integrated was sold.
 */
export function buildFormContexts(document: DocumentForForms): FormContext[] {
  const snapshot = document.entitySnapshot as { entityName?: string } | null;
  const distributorName = snapshot?.entityName ?? document.region.entityName;

  const company = document.company;
  const addressLines = company ? companyAddressLines(company) : [];

  const deliveryAddressLines =
    company && !company.deliverySameAsMain
      ? companyAddressLines({
          street: company.deliveryStreet,
          city: company.deliveryCity,
          state: company.deliveryState,
          postcode: company.deliveryPostcode,
          country: company.deliveryCountry,
        })
      : addressLines;

  const softwareCodes = document.items
    .filter((item) => resolveForm(item.code) === null)
    .map((item) => item.code);

  return document.items
    .filter((item) => resolveForm(item.code) !== null)
    .map((item) => {
      const options = item.lines.filter((line) => line.kind === "OPTION");

      const formItem: FormItem = {
        id: item.id,
        code: item.code,
        name: item.name,
        lineGroup: item.lineGroup,
        spec: (item.productionSpec ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>,
        optionCodes: options.map((line) => line.code).filter((c): c is string => Boolean(c)),
        optionAttributes: Object.fromEntries(
          options
            .filter((line) => line.code && line.attributes)
            .map((line) => [line.code as string, line.attributes as Record<string, unknown>]),
        ),
      };

      return {
        distributorName,
        authorName: document.author.name ?? "",
        company: {
          name: company?.name ?? "",
          addressLines,
          industry: company?.industry?.name ?? null,
        },
        contact: {
          fullName: [document.contact?.firstName, document.contact?.lastName].filter(Boolean).join(" "),
          position: document.contact?.position ?? null,
          phone: document.contact?.phone ?? null,
          email: document.contact?.email ?? null,

        deliveryAddressLines,
        softwareCodes,
        item: formItem,
      };
    });
}
```

Define `DocumentForForms` as the return type of the query you add in Task 14 (`Prisma.DocumentGetPayload<typeof productionFormsInclude>`), the same way `src/lib/sheet-data.ts` types its input. Until Task 14 exists, type it locally and tighten it then.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test to verify it passes**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-forms-context.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, 8 tests.

```bash
git add src/lib/production-forms/context.ts tests/production-forms-context.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: build production form context from a document"
```

- Modify: `src/lib/production-forms/specs/index.ts`
- Test: `tests/production-forms-resolve.test.ts` (extend)

- [ ] **Step 1: Copy the templates**

```bash
cp "RAW/Order Forms/Easy Loader 13.xlsx" src/lib/production-forms/templates/easy-loader-13.xlsx
cp "RAW/Order Forms/Fabric Pro order form 08.xlsx" src/lib/production-forms/templates/fabric-pro-order-form-08.xlsx

## Task 14: Rendering and the API route

**Files:**
- Create: `src/lib/production-forms/render.ts`
- Create: `src/components/sheet/additional-items-sheet.tsx`
- Create: `src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/production-forms/route.ts`
- Modify: `src/lib/queries/documents.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the query**

In `src/lib/queries/documents.ts`, add beside the existing builder query:

```ts
export const productionFormsInclude = {
  region: true,
  // `select`, not `true`: `author: true` pulls the whole User row --
  // passwordHash included -- into a payload that flows on to the renderer.
  // The forms print one field, the salesperson's name.
  author: { select: { name: true } },
  company: { include: { industry: true } },
  contact: true,
  items: { orderBy: { sortOrder: "asc" }, include: { lines: true } },
  lines: { where: { itemId: null } },
} satisfies Prisma.DocumentInclude;

export type DocumentForForms = Prisma.DocumentGetPayload<{ include: typeof productionFormsInclude }>;

/**
 * A document loaded for production form rendering, scoped to the caller the
 * same way `getDocumentForBuilder` is.
 */
export async function getDocumentForForms(user: SessionUser, documentId: string) {
  return db.document.findFirst({
    where: { id: documentId, ...documentWhereForUser(user) },
    include: productionFormsInclude,
  });
}
```

Then update `src/lib/production-forms/context.ts` to import `DocumentForForms` from here instead of its local type.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the renderer**

Create `src/lib/production-forms/render.ts`:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

const GOTENBERG_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000;

function gotenbergUrl(): string {
  const baseUrl = process.env.GOTENBERG_URL;
  if (!baseUrl) throw new Error("GOTENBERG_URL is not configured");
  return baseUrl;
}

async function postToGotenberg(route: string, form: FormData): Promise<Buffer> {
  const response = await fetch(`${gotenbergUrl()}${route}`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: form,
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(GOTENBERG_TIMEOUT_MS),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const snippet = (await response.text().catch(() => "")).slice(0, 500);
    throw new Error(`Gotenberg returned ${response.status}: ${snippet}`);
  }

  return Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());
}

/** Templates are committed beside the specs and read straight off disk. */
export function readTemplate(name: string): Uint8Array {
  const file = path.join(process.cwd(), "src/lib/production-forms/templates", name);
  return new Uint8Array(readFileSync(file));
}

/**
 * Converts a patched workbook to PDF. LibreOffice honours the template's own
 * print settings -- A4 portrait, an explicit print area, fitToPage -- so the
 * one-page-per-form guarantee comes from the template rather than from us.
 */
export async function xlsxToPdf(xlsx: Uint8Array, filename: string): Promise<Buffer> {
  const form = new FormData();
  form.set("files", new Blob([xlsx as BlobPart]), filename);
  return postToGotenberg("/forms/libreoffice/convert", form);
}

/** Concatenates PDFs in the order given. */
export async function mergePdfs(pdfs: Buffer[]): Promise<Buffer> {
  if (pdfs.length === 1) return pdfs[0];

  const form = new FormData();
  pdfs.forEach((pdf, index) => {
    // Gotenberg merges in lexical filename order, so the index is zero-padded.
    form.append("files", new Blob([new Uint8Array(pdf)], { type: "application/pdf" }),
      `${String(index).padStart(3, "0")}.pdf`);
  });
  return postToGotenberg("/forms/pdfengines/merge", form);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the Additional items sheet**

Create `src/components/sheet/additional-items-sheet.tsx`. Read `src/components/sheet/document-sheet.tsx` first and reuse its typography classes.

```tsx
export type AdditionalItem = {
  name: string;
  qty: number;
  description: string | null;
  /** Which machine this came from, or null for a document-level line. */
  source: string | null;
};

type Props = { documentNumber: string; companyName: string; items: AdditionalItem[] };

/**
 * Everything the machine forms deliberately do not carry: services, training,
 * custom entries, and any option this machine's form has no box for. One
 * sheet at the back rather than one after each form -- the workshop hands
 * forms out per machine, and a page stapled between two forms travels with
 * the wrong one. The machine form stays purely about what gets built;
 * nothing is silently dropped.
 */
export function AdditionalItemsSheet({ documentNumber, companyName, items }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="pq-content">
      <h1>Additional items</h1>
      <p>
        {documentNumber} — {companyName}
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Qty</th>
            <th>From</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {items.map((item, index) => (
            <tr key={index}>
              <td>{item.name}</td>
              <td>{item.qty}</td>
              <td>{item.source ?? "—"}</td>
              <td>{item.description ?? ""}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Not part of any production form. For office reference only.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the route**

Create `src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/production-forms/route.ts`:

```ts
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from "react-dom/server";
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { getDocumentForForms } from "@/lib/queries/documents";
import { htmlToPdf } from "@/lib/pdf";
import { buildFormContexts } from "@/lib/production-forms/context";
import {
  buildPatches,
  missingRequirements,
  resolveForm,
  unmatchedOptionCodes,
} from "@/lib/production-forms/resolve";
import { patchWorkbook } from "@/lib/production-forms/xlsx-patch";
import { mergePdfs, readTemplate, xlsxToPdf } from "@/lib/production-forms/render";
import { AdditionalItemsSheet, type AdditionalItem } from "@/components/sheet/additional-items-sheet";

export const runtime = "nodejs";

type Params = { documentId: string };

/**
 * Streams the production forms for a finalized quote as one PDF, one A4 page
 * per machine. `?item=<itemId>` narrows it to a single form.
 *
 * FINAL quotes only: a draft is still being reworked, and the workshop must
 * not receive a form for a machine whose options are about to change.
 */
export async function GET(request: Request, { params }: { params: Promise<Params> }) {
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session?.user) return Response.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });

  const { documentId } = await params;
  const document = await getDocumentForForms(session.user, documentId);
  if (!document) return Response.json({ error: "Not found" }, { status: 404 });

  if (document.type !== "QUOTE" || document.status !== "FINAL") {
    return Response.json({ error: "Production forms require a finalized quote" }, { status: 409 });
  }

  const onlyItemId = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get("item");
  const contexts = buildFormContexts(document).filter(
    (ctx) => !onlyItemId || ctx.item.id === onlyItemId,
  );

  if (contexts.length === 0) {
    return Response.json({ error: "No production forms apply to this quote" }, { status: 404 });
  }

  const blockers = contexts.flatMap((ctx) => {
    const spec = resolveForm(ctx.item.code)!;
    const missing = missingRequirements(spec, ctx.item.spec);
    return missing.length ? [{ itemId: ctx.item.id, code: ctx.item.code, missing }] : [];
  });

  if (blockers.length > 0) {
    return Response.json({ error: "Production details are incomplete", blockers }, { status: 422 });
  }

  const pdfs: Buffer[] = [];

  try {
    for (const ctx of contexts) {
      const spec = resolveForm(ctx.item.code)!;
      const patched = patchWorkbook(
        readTemplate(spec.template),
        spec.sheetPath,
        buildPatches(spec, ctx),
      );
      pdfs.push(await xlsxToPdf(patched, `${spec.id}.xlsx`));
    }

    // Document-level lines, plus every option whose machine's form has no box
    // for it. The second half is the important one: without it an option
    // would reach neither the form nor the workshop.
    const extras: AdditionalItem[] = [
      ...document.lines.map((line) => ({
        name: line.name,
        qty: line.qty,
        description: line.description,
        source: null,
      })),
      ...contexts.flatMap((ctx) => {
        const spec = resolveForm(ctx.item.code)!;
        const item = document.items.find((row) => row.id === ctx.item.id);
        return unmatchedOptionCodes(spec, ctx).map((code) => {
          const line = item?.lines.find((row) => row.code === code);
          return {
            name: line?.name ?? code,
            qty: line?.qty ?? 1,
            description: line?.description ?? null,
            source: `${ctx.item.code} — ${ctx.item.name}`,
          };
        });
      }),
    ];

    if (extras.length > 0 && !onlyItemId) {
      const body = renderToStaticMarkup(
        AdditionalItemsSheet({
          documentNumber: document.number ?? "",
          companyName: document.company?.name ?? "",
          items: extras,
        }),
      );
      pdfs.push(
        await htmlToPdf(
          `<!doctype html><html><head><meta charSet="utf-8"><style>@page{size:A4;margin:15mm}body{margin:0}</style></head><body>${body}</body></html>`,
        ),
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Production form generation failed", error);
    return Response.json({ error: "PDF service unavailable" }, { status: 502 });
  }

  const merged = await mergePdfs(pdfs);
  const filename = `${document.number ?? document.id}-production-forms.pdf`;

  return new Response(new Uint8Array(merged), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/pdf",
      "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="${filename}"`,
      "Cache-Control": "no-store",
    },
  });
}
```

Note: `renderToStaticMarkup` is imported statically here, unlike in `src/lib/pdf.ts`. If `next build` rejects it (read the comment at the top of `src/lib/pdf.ts` — it explains exactly this failure), switch to the same dynamic `await import("react-dom/server")` pattern that file uses.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify end to end**

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres gotenberg
npm run dev
```

Create a quote with an M-Series machine, fill its production spec, finalize it, then:

```bash
curl -sS -b "<your session cookie>" \
  "http://localhost:3100/api/documents/<id>/production-forms" -o /tmp/forms.pdf
pdfinfo /tmp/forms.pdf | grep Pages
```

Expected: `Pages: 1`. Open it and confirm the ticks match what the quote holds.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/production-forms/render.ts src/components/sheet/additional-items-sheet.tsx \
  "src/app/api/documents/[documentId]/production-forms/route.ts" src/lib/queries/documents.ts \
  src/lib/production-forms/context.ts
git commit -m "feat: render production forms to a merged PDF"
```

## Task 15: Spec contract test

**Files:**
- Test: `tests/production-forms-contract.test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

Create `tests/production-forms-contract.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { readFileSync, existsSync } from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import * as XLSX from "xlsx";
import { FORM_SPECS } from "../src/lib/production-forms/specs";

const TEMPLATE_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, "../src/lib/production-forms/templates");

function loadSheet(template: string) {
  const workbook = XLSX.read(readFileSync(path.join(TEMPLATE_DIR, template)), { type: "buffer" });
  return workbook.Sheets[workbook.SheetNames[0]];
}

/**
 * Guards the two dangerous typos: a tick aimed one row off into a cell that
 * holds a printed label, and a value aimed at a label instead of the blank
 * beside it. Border checking is not possible with SheetJS -- box coordinates
 * are confirmed visually when each spec is first written (see spec 11).
 */
describe.each(FORM_SPECS.map((spec) => [spec.id, spec] as const))("%s form spec", (_id, spec) => {
  it("has its template committed", () => {
    expect(existsSync(path.join(TEMPLATE_DIR, spec.template))).toBe(true);
  });

  it("declares a worksheet path that exists in the archive", () => {
    const workbook = XLSX.read(readFileSync(path.join(TEMPLATE_DIR, spec.template)), { type: "buffer" });
    expect(workbook.SheetNames.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(spec.sheetPath).toMatch(/^xl\/worksheets\/sheet\d+\.xml$/);
  });

  it("writes values only into blank cells", () => {
    const sheet = loadSheet(spec.template);
    for (const { cell } of spec.values) {
      expect(sheet[cell]?.v, `${spec.id} values cell ${cell} is not blank`).toBeUndefined();
    }
  });

  it("ticks only blank cells", () => {
    const sheet = loadSheet(spec.template);
    for (const { cell } of spec.ticks) {
      expect(sheet[cell]?.v, `${spec.id} tick cell ${cell} is not blank`).toBeUndefined();
    }
  });

  it("replaces only non-blank cells", () => {
    const sheet = loadSheet(spec.template);
    for (const { cell } of spec.replaces) {
      expect(sheet[cell]?.v, `${spec.id} replaces cell ${cell} is blank`).toBeDefined();
    }
  });

  it("uses no cell twice", () => {
    const cells = [...spec.values, ...spec.ticks, ...spec.replaces].map((entry) => entry.cell);
    expect(new Set(cells).size, `${spec.id} declares a cell more than once`).toBe(cells.length);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-forms-contract.test.ts`

Any failure is a real coordinate error, not a test problem. Correct the spec file against the template — reopen the xlsx and check which cell actually holds the label versus the blank beside it. Only after fixing every failure move on.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/production-forms-contract.test.ts
git commit -m "test: contract test pinning every form spec to its template"
```

## Task 16: Builder and document page UI

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/builder/production-spec-editor.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/documents/production-forms-section.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/builder/items-list.tsx`
- Modify: `src/app/(app)/documents/[documentId]/page.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the production spec editor**

Create `src/components/builder/production-spec-editor.tsx`. Read `src/components/builder/item-options-editor.tsx` first and match its autosave and layout conventions.

```tsx

      {error && <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{error}</p>}

}
```

Add these two helpers at the top of the same file, above the component:

```tsx
type Section = { lengthM: number; surface: "static" | "conveyor" };

/**
 * Replaces one table section, dropping any trailing section left with no
 * length. The form prints three section rows and the schema caps the array
 * at three, so a cleared section must shrink the array rather than leave a
 * zero-length hole the renderer would tick a surface box for.
 */
function writeSection(sections: Section[], index: number, next: Section): Section[] {
  const copy = [...sections];
  copy[index] = next;
  while (copy.length > 0 && !copy[copy.length - 1]?.lengthM) copy.pop();
  return copy.filter(Boolean);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Mount it in the item card**

In `src/components/builder/items-list.tsx`, below the existing options editor inside each item card:

```tsx
import { resolveForm } from "@/lib/production-forms/resolve";
import { ProductionSpecEditor } from "@/components/builder/production-spec-editor";

// once, above the item map -- the chip is noise on a single-machine quote
const machineCount = items.filter((item) => resolveForm(item.code) !== null).length;

// inside the item card, after the options editor
<ProductionSpecEditor
  itemId={item.id}
  itemCode={item.code}
  lineGroup={item.lineGroup}
  spec={(item.productionSpec ?? {}) as Record<string, unknown>}
  showLineChip={machineCount > 1}
/>
```

`ProductionSpecEditor` returns `null` for an item with no form, so software and service rows are unaffected.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the forms section**

Create `src/components/documents/production-forms-section.tsx`:

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { buildFormContexts } from "@/lib/production-forms/context";
import { missingRequirements, resolveForm, unmatchedOptionCodes } from "@/lib/production-forms/resolve";
import type { DocumentForForms } from "@/lib/queries/documents";

/**
 * Readiness list plus the download buttons. Rendered on FINAL quotes only --
 * the route enforces the same rule, so the UI and the server cannot disagree.
 */
export function ProductionFormsSection({ document }: { document: DocumentForForms }) {
  if (document.type !== "QUOTE" || document.status !== "FINAL") return null;

  const contexts = buildFormContexts(document);
  if (contexts.length === 0) {
    return <p>No production forms apply to this quote.</p>;
  }

  const rows = contexts.map((ctx) => {
    const spec = resolveForm(ctx.item.code)!;
    return { ctx, spec, missing: missingRequirements(spec, ctx.item.spec) };
  });

  const blocked = rows.some((row) => row.missing.length > 0);

  // Same arithmetic as the route: document-level lines plus every option no
  // form has a box for. Counting it differently here would let the button
  // promise a page count the PDF does not deliver.
  const extras =
    document.lines.length +
    rows.reduce((total, row) => total + unmatchedOptionCodes(row.spec, row.ctx).length, 0);

  const modulesWithoutHost =
    contexts[0].softwareCodes.some((code) => ["PDG", "WPN", "WPL", "ANT-V5", "ANT-V6"].includes(code)) &&
    !contexts[0].softwareCodes.some((code) => code === "PTW(I)" || code === "PTW(S)");

  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Production forms</h2>

      {modulesWithoutHost && (
        <p className="text-amber-600">
          PathWorks modules are on this quote with no PathWorks licence to host them.
        </p>
      )}

      <ul>
        {rows.map(({ ctx, spec, missing }) => (
          <li key={ctx.item.id}>
            <span>
              {spec.title} — {ctx.item.code}
            </span>
            {missing.length === 0 ? (
              <Link href={`/api/documents/${document.id}/production-forms?item=${ctx.item.id}`}>
                PDF
              </Link>
            ) : (
              <span className="text-amber-600">missing: {missing.join(", ")}</span>
            )}
          </li>
        ))}
        {extras > 0 && <li>Additional items ({extras})</li>}
      </ul>

      {blocked ? (
        <button type="button" disabled>
          Download all forms
        </button>
      ) : (
        <Link href={`/api/documents/${document.id}/production-forms`}>
          Download all forms ({rows.length + (extras > 0 ? 1 : 0)} pages)
        </Link>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Mount it on the document page**

In `src/app/(app)/documents/[documentId]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import { getDocumentForForms } from "@/lib/queries/documents";
import { ProductionFormsSection } from "@/components/documents/production-forms-section";

// alongside the existing document load
const formsDocument = await getDocumentForForms(session.user, documentId);

// below the existing document actions
{formsDocument && <ProductionFormsSection document={formsDocument} />}
```

The component returns `null` for anything that is not a FINAL quote, so no status check is needed at the call site.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify end to end**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build a quote with M-Series + EasyLoader + FabricPro. Confirm:

1. Before filling any production spec, every row shows its missing keys and the download button is disabled.
2. Setting `+Y` on the M-Series toast-confirms it also applied to the EasyLoader and FabricPro (same line).
3. Setting line 2 on one machine and then changing its side leaves line 1's machines untouched.
4. With everything filled, the download yields a 3-page PDF with correct ticks.
5. Adding a custom line adds a fourth "Additional items" page.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the whole suite and commit**

```bash
npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint
git add src/components/builder/production-spec-editor.tsx \
  src/components/documents/production-forms-section.tsx \
  src/components/builder/items-list.tsx \
  "src/app/(app)/documents/[documentId]/page.tsx"
git commit -m "feat: production spec editor and forms download section"
```

    expect(xml).toContain("Relaxvanguard");
    expect(xml).toContain("Automotive");
    expect(xml).toContain("2 x 6mm");
    expect(xml).toContain("14");

    for (const cell of ["J25", "J29", "J33", "J52", "F68", "D72", "J64"]) {
      expect(xml, `expected a tick in ${cell}`).toMatch(
        new RegExp(`<c r="${cell}"[^>]*t="inlineStr"><is><t[^>]*>X</t>`),
      );
    }
  });

  it("leaves untouched every box the quote did not ask for", () => {

    const patched = patchWorkbook(readTemplate(spec.template), spec.sheetPath, buildPatches(spec, ctx));
    const xml = strFromU8(unzipSync(patched)[spec.sheetPath]);

    // H25 is model M3, O25 is M10 -- neither was ordered.
    for (const cell of ["H25", "O25", "L25"]) {
      expect(xml).not.toMatch(new RegExp(`<c r="${cell}"[^>]*t="inlineStr"`));
    }
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/production-forms-pipeline.test.ts`
Expected: PASS, 2 tests.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the whole suite**

```bash
npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint
```

Expected: all green.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/production-forms-pipeline.test.ts
git commit -m "test: end-to-end production form patching golden test"
```

## Done

At this point a finalized quote with M-Series, EasyLoader and FabricPro produces one PDF with three A4 pages, each a faithful copy of the form production already knows, with every derivable box ticked.

Adding one of the remaining ten forms is: copy the xlsx into `templates/`, write a spec file, register it in `specs/index.ts`, extend the resolve tests, run the contract test, and check one printed page by eye.
