# Operations Runbook

PathQuote deploys from `main` to a single VPS via GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). The app runs under Docker Compose
(`docker compose`) as three services — `app`, `postgres`, `gotenberg` — with
`app` bound to `127.0.0.1:3010` and Nginx reverse-proxying the public domain
`q.pathfindercut.com` in front of it.

## 1. One-time VPS setup

Run once, on a fresh VPS with Docker, Docker Compose, git, and Nginx already
installed.

1. Clone the repo to the path the deploy workflow expects:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:hottabov/pathquote.git /opt/pathquote
   cd /opt/pathquote
   ```

   The deploy job runs `git pull --ff-only` from this exact path, so it must
   be `/opt/pathquote` and the working tree must stay on `main` with no local
   commits ahead of origin.

2. Create the environment file from the template and fill in real values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   - `AUTH_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — a strong random password; must match the password
     portion of `DATABASE_URL`.
   - `DATABASE_URL` — `postgresql://pathquote:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@postgres:5432/pathquote`
     (the `postgres` host is the Compose service name, not `localhost`).
   - `AUTH_URL` — `https://q.pathfindercut.com`.
   - `SMTP_*` / `EMAIL_FROM` — for magic-link email. Leaving `SMTP_*` blank
     disables magic-link login; password login is unaffected.
   - `GOTENBERG_URL` — `http://gotenberg:3000` (leave as-is; matches the
     Compose service name).
   - `UPLOADS_DIR` — `/data/uploads` (matches the `uploads` volume mount).

   `.env` is git-ignored and never leaves the VPS.

3. Log in to GHCR so the box can pull the images CI builds.

   The registry accepts **only a classic personal access token** — fine-grained
   tokens do not authenticate to GHCR, whatever their package permissions
   ([GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry):
   "GitHub Packages only supports authentication using a personal access token
   (classic)"). The VPS never builds or pushes, so give it the narrowest scope
   that exists for this: `read:packages`, and nothing else.

   Create it at **github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access
   tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token (classic)**, or open the
   pre-scoped form directly:

   <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=read:packages&description=pathquote-vps-pull>

   Tick **only** `read:packages` — the UI pre-selects `repo` when you touch
   `write:packages`, which would hand the box full repository access it has no
   use for. Set an expiry you will actually renew (90 days is reasonable; the
   symptom of an expired token is `docker compose pull` failing with
   `denied`). Copy the token — GitHub shows it once.

   Then on the VPS, paste it at the prompt (the `read -rs` line waits silently
   for input, so nothing is echoed and nothing lands in shell history):

   ```bash
   read -rs GHCR_TOKEN && echo
   echo "$GHCR_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u hottabov --password-stdin
   unset GHCR_TOKEN
   ```

   Expect `Login Succeeded`. The credential is stored in
   `~/.docker/config.json` and survives reboots, so this is a one-time step.

   Verify before relying on it:

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/hottabov/pathquote:latest
   ```

   (This fails with `manifest unknown` until CI has pushed at least once —
   that is a different error from `denied`, which means the token is wrong.)

   The packages are `ghcr.io/hottabov/pathquote` (the app) and
   `ghcr.io/hottabov/pathquote-tools` (migrations, seeding, operator scripts).
   Both are private by default and inherit the repository's access.

4. Pull and start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile tools pull app tools
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Without a `TAG` in the environment both services resolve to `:latest`,
   which is what CI tags on every successful deploy. To pin a specific build,
   `export TAG=<commit sha>` first — that is exactly what the deploy workflow
   does, and what a rollback uses (see §5).

5. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

6. Seed the catalog (idempotent — safe to re-run, ~4s):

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm tools npm run db:seed
   docker compose run --rm tools npm run db:verify-seed   # optional sanity check
   ```

7. Create the first admin user. Prefer piping the password in rather than
   typing it as a plain CLI argument — anything passed as an argv token is
   written to the shell's history file (`~/.bash_history` etc.) and is
   visible to any other process on the box via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` while it
   runs. Two safer options, both using the existing
   `npm run user:create -- <email> <password> ADMIN AU` script:

   - **Environment variable, unset immediately after:**

     ```bash
     read -rs ADMIN_PW && echo
     docker compose run --rm -e ADMIN_PW tools sh -c \
       'npm run user:create -- you@example.com "$ADMIN_PW" ADMIN AU'
     unset ADMIN_PW
     ```

   - **Interactive shell inside the container**, typing the password at a
     prompt so it never appears in either host or container shell history:

     ```bash
     docker compose run --rm tools sh
     # inside the container:
     npm run user:create -- you@example.com "$(read -rsp 'password: ' p && echo "$p")" ADMIN AU
     exit
     ```

   Either way, clear your host shell history afterwards if the password did
   end up on the command line (`history -d <line>` or `history -c`).

8. Verify: `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health` should return
   `{"ok":true,"db":true,"schemaOk":true}`, and
   `https://q.pathfindercut.com/login` should load once Nginx and TLS are
   configured (section 3).

## 2. GitHub repository secrets

Add these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on
`github.com/hottabov/pathquote`. The `deploy` job in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` reads them via `appleboy/ssh-action@v1`.

| Secret        | Value                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VPS_HOST`    | VPS hostname or IP                                              |
| `VPS_USER`    | SSH user with access to `/opt/pathquote` and the `docker` group |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Private key for a **dedicated deploy key**                      |

For `VPS_SSH_KEY`, generate a dedicated keypair rather than reusing a
personal key (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy_key -N ""`), add the public
half to the VPS user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and paste the private half
into the secret. Since the workflow only needs `git pull` (read access) plus
local Docker/Prisma commands already on the box, the corresponding GitHub
deploy key (if you also register the public key as a repo Deploy Key rather
than relying on an already-cloned repo with its own remote credentials)
only needs **read access** — do not grant it write/push access.

No registry secret is needed here: the `build` job pushes to GHCR with the
workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` under `permissions: packages: write`. Only the
VPS needs a credential of its own, and it is read-only (§1, step 3).

## 2b. What a deploy actually does

Since 2026-09-04 the VPS builds nothing. On a push to `main`:

1. **`ci`** — one runner, one `npm ci`: lint, typecheck, tests, then against a
   Postgres service container `prisma migrate diff --exit-code` (schema has a
   matching migration), migrate, seed twice (idempotency), `db:verify-seed`.
2. **`build`** — builds the `run` and `tools` targets on a 4-vCPU runner with
   a persistent BuildKit layer cache and pushes both to GHCR, tagged with the
   commit SHA and `latest`.
3. **`deploy`** — SSH to the VPS: `git pull` (for `docker-compose.yml` only),
   `docker compose pull`, `up -d postgres`, `prisma migrate deploy` from the
   `tools` image, `up -d app gotenberg`, then a health check that asserts both
   `"ok":true` and `"schemaOk":true` before pruning old layers.

Migrations always run before the new app starts, so the code and the schema
can never disagree in the window between them.

### Rolling back

The previous image is still on the box (the workflow's `docker image prune -f`
keeps tagged images) and every build is in GHCR by SHA:

```bash
cd /opt/pathquote
TAG=<previous commit sha> docker compose up -d app
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health
```

If that SHA's image was pruned, `TAG=<sha> docker compose pull app` first.

A rollback does **not** revert migrations. If the bad deploy migrated the
schema, roll back to a commit whose code still works against the current
schema, or restore from a dump (§4).

## 3. Nginx + TLS

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pathquote`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name q.pathfindercut.com;

    client_max_body_size 25m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3010;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Enable and reload:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pathquote /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pathquote
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

Then obtain a certificate with certbot (adds the TLS `server` block and the
HTTP→HTTPS redirect automatically):

```bash
certbot --nginx -d q.pathfindercut.com
```

Certbot's systemd timer renews automatically; confirm it's active with
`systemctl status certbot.timer`.

## 4. Backups

The live VPS runs `/usr/local/bin/pq-backup.sh` from root's crontab at 03:00.
It dumps Postgres *and* the `uploads` volume (uploaded files are not in the
database), writes each artifact to a `.tmp` path and renames it only after the
command succeeds — a dump that dies partway leaves a `.tmp` behind instead of a
truncated file that looks like a valid backup — then prunes anything older than
14 days:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

BACKUP_DIR=/opt/backups
COMPOSE=/opt/pathquote/docker-compose.yml
KEEP_DAYS=14
STAMP=$(date +%F)

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

docker compose -f "$COMPOSE" exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U pathquote pathquote | gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/pq-$STAMP.sql.gz.tmp"
mv "$BACKUP_DIR/pq-$STAMP.sql.gz.tmp" "$BACKUP_DIR/pq-$STAMP.sql.gz"

docker run --rm \
  -v pathquote_uploads:/data:ro \
  -v "$BACKUP_DIR":/backup \
  alpine tar czf "/backup/uploads-$STAMP.tar.gz.tmp" -C /data .
mv "$BACKUP_DIR/uploads-$STAMP.tar.gz.tmp" "$BACKUP_DIR/uploads-$STAMP.tar.gz"

find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name 'pq-*.sql.gz'      -mtime +$KEEP_DAYS -delete
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name 'uploads-*.tar.gz' -mtime +$KEEP_DAYS -delete
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name '*.tmp'            -mtime +1          -delete

echo "$(date -Is) backup ok"
```

Crontab entry:

```cron
0 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/pq-backup.sh >> /var/log/pq-backup.log 2>&1
```

Verify a dump is real, not just present:

```bash
gunzip -t /opt/backups/pq-$(date +%F).sql.gz
zcat /opt/backups/pq-$(date +%F).sql.gz | grep -c 'CREATE TABLE'   # expect ~19
```

`/opt/backups` sits on the same disk as the database, so it protects against a
bad migration or an accidental `DROP`, not against losing the VPS. Off-site
copies (rclone to object storage) are still TODO.

The two plain cron entries below are the minimal equivalent, kept for
reference on a host without the script.

### Nightly dump

Add to the deploy user's crontab (`crontab -e`):

```cron
0 3 * * * mkdir -p /opt/backups && docker compose -f /opt/pathquote/docker-compose.yml exec -T postgres pg_dump -U pathquote pathquote | gzip > /opt/backups/pq-$(date +\%F).sql.gz
```

### 14-day rotation

Add a second cron entry to prune anything older than 14 days:

```cron
30 3 * * * find /opt/backups -name 'pq-*.sql.gz' -mtime +14 -delete
```

(The `\%F` escaping above is required because `%` is special to cron; when
editing the crontab directly via `crontab -e` the same escaping applies.)

### Restore procedure

1. Stop the app so it isn't writing during restore (Postgres can stay up):

   ```bash
   docker compose stop app
   ```

2. Restore from a chosen dump:

   ```bash
   gunzip -c /opt/backups/pq-2026-08-29.sql.gz | \
     docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U pathquote -d pathquote
   ```

   Restoring into a database with existing tables can conflict; for a clean
   restore, drop and recreate the database first (destructive — confirm you
   have the dump you want):

   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U pathquote -d postgres -c \
     "DROP DATABASE pathquote; CREATE DATABASE pathquote OWNER pathquote;"
   gunzip -c /opt/backups/pq-2026-08-29.sql.gz | \
     docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U pathquote -d pathquote
   ```

3. Bring the app back up and re-verify migrations are in sync (Prisma
   tracks applied migrations in the restored dump, so this should be a
   no-op if the dump matches the current schema):

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d app
   docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy
   curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health
   ```

## 4b. Replacing production with your local database

Used while the tool is still being built and production holds nothing worth
keeping: it makes production an exact copy of a local machine — catalogue,
users, clients, quotes and uploaded files.

**This deletes everything currently on production**, including the accounts
people sign in with. Afterwards the only logins that exist are the ones from
the local database. If production ever holds a real quote or a real user,
stop and copy only what is needed instead — `npm run db:seed` on the VPS
already brings the catalogue across from the repository without touching a
single user.

Two things live in different places on the two machines, which is why this is
not a single command:

- **Postgres** is a container on both, so it dumps and restores the same way.
- **Uploaded files** are a Docker volume on the VPS (`pathquote_uploads`,
  mounted at `/data/uploads`), but on a development machine the app runs on
  the host and `UPLOADS_DIR` is unset, so they sit in `data/uploads` inside
  the repository.

On the local machine:

```bash
cd "/path/to/PF Invoice"
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U pathquote pathquote | gzip > /tmp/pq-local.sql.gz
tar czf /tmp/uploads-local.tar.gz -C data/uploads .
scp /tmp/pq-local.sql.gz /tmp/uploads-local.tar.gz USER@VPS:/tmp/
```

On the VPS:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/pq-backup.sh          # back up what is about to be replaced
cd /opt/pathquote
docker compose stop app                   # nothing may hold a connection

# WITH (FORCE) drops the database even though other sessions are attached;
# without it the DROP simply blocks.
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U pathquote -d postgres \
  -c "DROP DATABASE pathquote WITH (FORCE);" \
  -c "CREATE DATABASE pathquote OWNER pathquote;"
gunzip -c /tmp/pq-local.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U pathquote -d pathquote

# Confirm the volume name first — it follows the Compose project directory.
docker volume ls | grep uploads
docker run --rm -v pathquote_uploads:/data -v /tmp:/backup alpine \
  sh -c "rm -rf /data/* && tar xzf /backup/uploads-local.tar.gz -C /data"

docker compose up -d app
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health
```

`.env` never leaves the VPS, so production keeps its own secrets and database
password — only data is copied. The dump carries `_prisma_migrations` with it,
so a `migrate deploy` afterwards is a no-op as long as both machines are on the
same commit; if the local machine is behind, deploy the branch first and
migrate there, then copy.

Sign in immediately afterwards and confirm an account works. The only
credentials that now exist are the local ones, and finding that out later
means being locked out of production.

## 5. Troubleshooting

**App won't respond / health check failing**

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health   # {"ok":true} expected
docker compose ps                             # all services should be "healthy"/"running"
docker compose logs -f app                    # tail app logs
docker compose logs -f postgres               # tail Postgres logs
docker compose logs -f gotenberg              # tail Gotenberg logs
```

The `/api/health` route runs `SELECT 1` against Postgres on every request
(it is never cached), so a `503` with `"db":false` almost always means the
database is unreachable or `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is wrong — check
`docker compose logs postgres` and confirm the app's `.env` matches the
Postgres container's credentials.

The route also reports `"schemaOk"`, a separate probe (`findFirst` on
`User.phone`, `Document.showItemPrices`, and `Region.maxDiscountPct` — the
newest migrated columns) distinct from plain connectivity. `"db":true` with
`"schemaOk":false` means Postgres answers fine but the schema is stale —
migrations weren't applied for the code currently running. This is the
`{"ok":true}`-that-actually-means-broken failure mode from the 2026-08-31
incident, where migrations 4-7 never ran and every login failed with
"Invalid credentials" even though `SELECT 1` succeeded the whole time.

**If all logins fail with "Invalid credentials"** → don't assume bad
passwords. Check `docker compose logs app | grep -i prisma` for a `P2022`
(missing column) or other `P1xxx`/`P2xxx` error first — `src/auth.ts` logs
these loudly (`[auth] infrastructure error ...`) instead of masking them as
a failed login. Then check `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health` for
`"schemaOk":false` and run the manual recovery command below.

**Migrations out of sync**

```bash
docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate status
```

Shows pending/failed migrations. To re-apply cleanly:

```bash
docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy
```

If a migration is reported as failed partway through, resolve it manually
per the Prisma CLI's guidance (`prisma migrate resolve`) before retrying —
do not re-run `migrate deploy` blindly against a half-applied migration.

**Deploy workflow fails at the SSH step**

- Confirm `VPS_HOST` / `VPS_USER` / `VPS_SSH_KEY` secrets are current and the
  public key is still in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the VPS.
- Confirm `/opt/pathquote` has no local commits/changes blocking
  `git pull --ff-only` (`git status` on the VPS).

Read the log carefully before touching the secrets: two different SSH hops
fail with similar-looking errors, and only one of them involves them at all.

**`git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` during the deploy script**

GitHub Actions reached the VPS fine — the script is running, and it is the
VPS's own `git pull` that cannot authenticate *to GitHub*. The `VPS_SSH_KEY`
secret is not involved.

The tell is the host in the message. The pull is supposed to go through the
`github-pf` alias in the deploy user's `~/.ssh/config`, which is what points
it at `~/.ssh/pf_invoice_deploy`; a literal `git@github.com` means the alias
was bypassed and ssh offered whatever default key it had. Renaming the
repository is how this happens — the natural fix afterwards is
`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:owner/name.git`, which quietly
drops the alias.

```bash
cd /opt/pathquote
git remote -v                                            # expect github-pf:...
git remote set-url origin github-pf:hottabov/pathquote.git
ssh -T github-pf                                         # should greet the repo
```

Belt and braces, so the next rename cannot reintroduce it — this binds the
key to the repository rather than to the remote's spelling:

```bash
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/pf_invoice_deploy -o IdentitiesOnly=yes"
```

**`Not possible to fast-forward, aborting` during the deploy script**

`main` was force-pushed (history rewritten) and the VPS still holds the old
commits, so there is no fast-forward path. `git pull` prints the old and new
tips on its `forced update` line, which names the commit the VPS is stuck on.

The VPS is a deployment checkout and must never hold work of its own, so the
resolution is to discard its history, not to merge it:

```bash
cd /opt/pathquote
git status --short          # MUST be empty; investigate anything listed
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

`.env` is git-ignored and survives this. Do not run `git clean` — nothing
here needs it, and it reaches files the reset deliberately leaves alone.

**Deploy workflow fails at `docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate
deploy` or the final health check**

The deploy job (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs, in order: `git pull`,
`docker compose build` (images only, nothing started yet), `docker compose
up -d postgres`, `docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy`,
then `docker compose up -d --build` to start/update `app` and `gotenberg`,
then polls `/api/health` (up to 10 tries, 3s apart) until it sees both
`"ok":true` and `"schemaOk":true`. Migrations always run against the new
code's Postgres *before* the new app code is started, and the whole script
is `set -euo pipefail`, so a failed `migrate deploy` or a schema that still
doesn't check out after the app starts stops the job — it will never report
green while `schemaOk` is `false`.

What the deploy does **not** do is seed. Migrations reshape the schema; the
catalogue's own contents come from `prisma/seed-data/`, and nothing on this
path reads them. So a release that adds or reprices a product or an option
needs one more command on the VPS after the deploy goes green:

```bash
cd /opt/pathquote
docker compose run --rm tools npm run db:seed
```

Skipping it is not cosmetic. The EasyLoader builder, for one, writes option
codes it assembles from the product code (see `EL_OPTION_SUFFIX`), and
`setItemOptions` rejects a code the database does not have — so an unseeded
production would refuse to save an EasyLoader at all, with an error naming
a code that exists perfectly well in the repository.

- SSH in and repeat the same commands manually (`docker compose run --rm
  tools npx prisma migrate deploy`, then `curl -fsS
  http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health`) to see the actual error before deciding
  whether to roll back.
- `docker compose logs app` for the stack trace.
- Manual recovery once the actual migration problem is fixed (e.g. after
  resolving a failed migration per the "Migrations out of sync" section
  above):

  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy && docker compose restart app
  ```

**Rolling back a bad deploy**

```bash
cd /opt/pathquote
git log --oneline -5      # find the last good commit
git checkout <good-sha>
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm tools npx prisma migrate deploy
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/health
```

Return to `main` (`git checkout main`) once a fix is pushed, so the next
automated deploy's `git pull --ff-only` succeeds.

**Testing PDF download locally (Gotenberg)**

The PDF route (`GET /api/documents/[documentId]/pdf`, `src/app/api/
documents/[documentId]/pdf/route.ts`) needs a reachable Gotenberg instance —
there is none in the sandbox this was built in, so this pipeline is
code-verified only until checked against a real container. To check it
locally:

```bash
docker compose up -d gotenberg
# GOTENBERG_URL=http://localhost:3001 in your local .env matches the port
# gotenberg's compose service publishes for host access; in-cluster it's
# http://gotenberg:3000, per .env.example.
npm run dev
```

Then either:

- Log in at `http://localhost:3100/login`, open any document's builder page
  or `/documents/<id>/preview`, and click **Download PDF** — the browser
  already carries the session cookie the route requires.
- Or, with a valid session cookie copied from the browser's dev tools
  (Application → Cookies → `authjs.session-token` or `__Secure-authjs.
  session-token`), hit the route directly:

  ```bash
  curl -v --cookie "authjs.session-token=<value>" \
    http://localhost:3100/api/documents/<documentId>/pdf \
    -o out.pdf
  file out.pdf   # should report "PDF document"
  ```

A `502 {"error":"PDF service unavailable"}` response means the route reached
the auth/scope/render steps fine but Gotenberg itself is unreachable or
returned a non-200 — check `docker compose logs gotenberg` and confirm
`GOTENBERG_URL` in `.env` points at the right host:port. A `401` means the
cookie is missing/expired; a `404` means the document id doesn't exist or
isn't visible to that user (wrong scope) — both are indistinguishable by
design, same as the preview page.

## 6. Host environment notes (IONOS + WordOps)

The production box is an IONOS VPS running Ubuntu 22.04 with WordOps already
installed (its own Nginx build, UFW, fail2ban). That combination breaks Docker
in several non-obvious ways. Everything below is already applied on the live
host — this section exists so a rebuild does not rediscover it the hard way.

### systemd-networkd steals Docker's veth interfaces

Symptom: every container is unreachable — DNS times out, `ping` to the bridge
gateway fails, `bridge link show` is empty, and `tcpdump` on the bridge sees
nothing at all. `iptables` counters stay at zero because the packets never make
it past layer 2. `npm ci` inside a build fails with the misleading
`npm error Exit handler never called!`.

Cause: netplan generates `/run/systemd/network/10-netplan-all.network` with
`Name=*`, so systemd-networkd manages `docker0`, `br-*` and every `veth*` and
un-enslaves them from their bridge. networkd applies the *first* matching file
in lexicographic order, so an override must sort before `10-`:

```bash
cat > /etc/systemd/network/05-docker-unmanaged.network <<'EOF'
[Match]
Name=docker0 veth* br-*

[Link]
Unmanaged=yes
EOF

systemctl restart systemd-networkd
systemctl stop docker && ip link del docker0; systemctl start docker
```

Verify with `networkctl list` — Docker interfaces must read `unmanaged`, and
`bridge link show` must list a veth with `master docker0 state forwarding`.

### UFW blocks container egress

WordOps ships `DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP"` in `/etc/default/ufw`, which
drops forwarded container traffic. Set it to `ACCEPT` and `ufw reload`. Note
this only restores forwarding; Docker publishes ports via its own `DOCKER-USER`
chain and bypasses UFW either way, which is why `app` binds to
`127.0.0.1:3010` rather than `0.0.0.0`.

`/etc/docker/daemon.json` also pins the bridge address, since the daemon left
`docker0` without an IPv4 address on this host:

```json
{ "bip": "172.17.0.1/16" }
```

### Nginx: do not add global directives

WordOps already sets `client_max_body_size 100m` in `nginx.conf`. Adding
another one in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` makes `nginx -t` fail with `directive is
duplicate`, which in turn makes acme.sh's `reloadcmd` fail, which makes
`wo site update --letsencrypt` report `Deploying SSL cert [KO]` even though the
certificate was issued successfully. Check `nginx -t` first whenever WordOps
fails to deploy a certificate; per-site overrides belong in
`/var/www/<domain>/conf/nginx/`.

The site itself is a WordOps proxy site:

```bash
wo site create q.pathfindercut.com --proxy=127.0.0.1:3010
wo site update q.pathfindercut.com --letsencrypt --dns=dns_cf   # or plain --letsencrypt for HTTP-01
```

DNS lives in Cloudflare with the record set to **DNS only**. If it is ever
switched to Proxied, HTTP-01 validation stops working — use `--dns=dns_cf`
(needs `CF_Token` + `CF_Account_ID` exported) and set Cloudflare's SSL mode to
Full (strict).

### SSH runs on a non-default port

WordOps moves sshd to a custom port, so the deploy workflow reads it from the
`VPS_PORT` secret (`appleboy/ssh-action` defaults to 22). Two *different* keys
are involved and they are easy to confuse:

- `~/.ssh/pf_invoice_deploy` — GitHub **deploy key**, public half registered on
  the repository, used by `git pull` on the VPS via the `github-pf` host alias
  in `~/.ssh/config`. Never goes into a GitHub secret.
- `~/.ssh/gha_pathquote` — key for **GitHub Actions to log into the VPS**,
  public half in the VPS's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, private half in the
  `VPS_SSH_KEY` secret.

Putting the deploy key in `VPS_SSH_KEY` produces
`ssh: handshake failed: ... [none publickey]`. `/var/log/auth.log` on the VPS
is the fastest way to tell a rejected key from a wrong port or a banned IP.

### After `npm ci`: "Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'"

Prisma 7 dropped the automatic `prisma generate` on install, so a fresh
`npm ci` leaves `node_modules/.prisma` absent and every import of
`@prisma/client` fails at module evaluation — which, because `src/proxy.ts`
pulls in `src/auth.ts`, takes down the middleware and turns *every* route into
a 404. The Dockerfile always called `npx prisma generate` explicitly; local
installs had nothing equivalent.

Fixed by a `postinstall: prisma generate` script. If you hit it on an older
checkout, run `npx prisma generate` by hand.

That script has a consequence in the Dockerfile: `npm ci` now runs
`prisma generate`, which needs `prisma.config.ts` and `prisma/schema.prisma` to
be present. The `deps` stage previously copied only `package*.json`, so the
build died with `Could not find Prisma Schema` inside `RUN npm ci`. It now
copies those two files as well — deliberately not the whole `prisma/`
directory, so that a migration or a `seed-data/` edit doesn't invalidate the
`npm ci` layer. If you add another install-time dependency on a repo file,
it has to be copied there too.

Verify a change to that stage without a full deploy:

```bash
docker build --target deps -t pq-deps-check .
```

Related: `node_modules` holds platform-specific native binaries
(`@node-rs/argon2-*`, `@next/swc-*`, `lightningcss-*`). Running `npm install`
against the same working tree from a different OS — a Linux container sharing
the folder, say — makes npm re-resolve optional dependencies for *that*
platform and drop the host's. Symptom: `Cannot find native binding`. Recovery
is `rm -rf node_modules .next && npm ci` on the host.

### CI type-checking needs generated route types

Next.js 16 generates `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` into `.next/types` during
`next dev`/`next build`, so a bare `tsc --noEmit` in CI fails with
`TS2304: Cannot find name 'LayoutProps'`. The `typecheck` script therefore runs
`next typegen && tsc --noEmit`.

### Creating the first admin: watch the password argument

`scripts/create-user.ts` sets `passwordHash` only when a non-empty password is
passed, and silently creates a login-less user otherwise. `read -rs ADMIN_PW`
creates a *shell* variable while `docker compose run -e ADMIN_PW` forwards from
the *environment*, so the password arrives empty unless it is exported — and
pasting the `read` line together with the following lines makes `read` consume
the next line instead of the typed password. Always confirm afterwards:

```sql
select email, active, ("passwordHash" is not null) as has_pw from "User";
```
