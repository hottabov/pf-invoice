 *
 * Source:  RAW/11 Price List Australia 2026-05-28.xlsx  (9 sheets total).
 * The "Order" sheet is a pure cross-sheet aggregation (SUM/lookup formulas

 * Run:     npm run extract:catalog
 *
 * Background reading: docs/reference/price-list-analysis.md. That report is
 * a useful map of the file but its counts are explicitly approximate ("~").
 * This script reads every relevant cell directly (including cached formula
 * results) and is the source of truth; every non-obvious decision below is
 * commented at the point it's made, and the run-time summary reports actual
 * counts so drift from the report is visible rather than silently swallowed.
 *
 * Classification rules (series / product vs. option), duplicate handling,
 * and known data gaps are all implemented per the Task 7 spec; see comments
 * inline for the reasoning behind each judgment call.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Per-sheet extraction
//
// Series/product-vs-option classification follows the Task 7 spec (as
// corrected by the later catalog-reclassification fix below): within
// M-series, L-Series and Punchline the sheet has a dedicated machine-code
// column (product) separate from an accessory column (option), so we use
// sheet position directly. FabricPro's FP-180/FP-220 match the spec's
// explicit "FM/FP models -> products" cue and are standalone machines in
// their own right, so they're classified as FabricPro products (TPL/Crate
// remain options); M-series' FM180 is left as an M-series option since it
// lives structurally in that sheet's accessory column, not its machine
// column. The Leather Nesting System's 3 LNS-* rows are "clearly standalone
// systems" and are products, with no options of their own.
//
// EasyLoader, EasyFeeder and Software were originally (incorrectly) treated
// as pure accessory sheets with no dedicated machine/product column, which
// left all three series with 0 products -- making their machines/modules
// impossible to add to a document. Re-verified against the source sheets:
//  - EasyLoader has two width sections, each headed by a priced
//    "Drive Module (first 1.2M)" row that IS the base machine for that
//    width; the remaining rows in each section are accessories scoped to
//    that specific drive-module product (not the EL series generally), so
//    they carry compatibleProducts instead of compatibleSeries.
//  - EasyFeeder's three rows (2020/2420/4030) are each a complete,
//    standalone unit with no separate accessory rows -- all products.
//  - Software's rows are all standalone, independently sellable modules
//    (including the SW-sheet "PRA" and the two-row "LS Convert" straddle)
//    with no accessory/option split on that sheet -- all products. The
//    L-Series sheet's own "PRA" row (a different price) remains an L-scoped
//    option, explicitly coded "PRA-L" so it can't collide with the SW
//    product code "PRA" now that there's no second "PRA" option to
//    auto-suffix it via the merge/split logic below.

// North America (NA) products
//
// Hand-authored products confirmed to exist by
// RAW/Price List North America (01-06-2026).xlsx (see scripts/extract-us-prices.ts)
// but with no row at all in the AU price list this catalog is otherwise
// extracted from -- so, like MANUAL_PRODUCTS above, they can't come from any
// extract*() function here. Kept as a separate, dedicated list (per spec)
// rather than folded into MANUAL_PRODUCTS, so its NA provenance stays
// traceable. Every entry here is price: null / needsReview: true for AU --
// exactly the MANUAL_PRODUCTS convention -- because the AU price genuinely
// doesn't exist yet; that is distinct from "no price at all". Each has a
// real US price captured separately, by scripts/extract-us-prices.ts, into
// prisma/seed-data/prices-us.json and applied only to the US region's Price
// rows by prisma/seed.ts -- never written into this file's AU price/
// needsReview fields.
//
// Evidence (sheet, and the NA row this was read from):
//  - M3300/M5300/M7300/M10300: M-series sheet rows 7/11/15/19 -- a "300cm
//    cutting width" tier that doesn't exist at all in the AU M-series sheet
//    (AU only has 180/220/390). Every one of the 3/5/7/10cm height variants
//    gets this new width, not just M3300 -- all four are genuinely new
//    machines, not a single isolated addition.
//  - L-320E: L-Series sheet row 7, an "Extended" 320cm-width variant with
//    its own row (and its own price) distinct from the existing L-320/
//    L-320F. (Note: its NA description literally says "Width 226cm" --
//    that's not a NA-specific typo; the AU sheet's own existing L-320 row
//    carries the exact same "226cm" text, so it's reproduced here verbatim
//    rather than silently corrected, per this script's usual policy of
//    trusting source text as-is.)
//  - PTW(I): Software sheet row 7, coded "PTW (I)" (normalized to "PTW(I)",
//    stripping the space before the parenthesis) -- a standalone SW-series
//    product distinct from the existing "PTW(S)" SW product and from the
//    unrelated cross-series "PTW" GlobalOption (M/X/L-compatible, sourced
//    from the AU M-series/L-Series sheets) -- per spec, this is added as a
//    new product, not merged into that option.
//  - EL-3220/EL-4030: EasyLoader sheet has FOUR width sections in the NA
//    file (2020/2420/3220/4030), not the two (2020/2420) in the AU sheet --
//    each headed by its own priced "Drive Module (first 1.2M)" row, exactly
//    like the two existing EL products. The 3220/4030 sections' accessory
//    rows (Additional lengths, Static table, Electrical Runner, Travel
//    platform, Crate, Installation) have no equivalent options in the
//    existing catalog and are NOT added as options here -- see
//    scripts/extract-us-prices.ts's unmatched[] output, they're reported,
//    not invented.
//  - EF-3220: EasyFeed sheet has FOUR width sections (2020/2420/3220/4030)
//    vs. the catalog's existing 3 EF products (2020/2420/4030) -- 3220 is
//    the missing one.
//  - FP-300: FabricPro sheet has a third FP-300 section (68000) beyond the
//    existing FP-180/FP-220.
//
// Not added despite a "300"-width pattern: X-Calibre. The X-series sheet
// only prices two machine codes at all (X10180, X10220 -- both already
// mapped to existing X-10180/X-10220), so there is no NA evidence for an
// X-3300-style product the way there is for M3300 et al. X's own products
// are cloned from M-Series' products earlier in this file (see "X-Calibre"
// below) -- that clone happens before this NA_PRODUCTS append, so it does
// NOT pick up M3300/M5300/M7300/M10300 either; X stays at its original 12
// products.

// needsReview: true -- none of these are published in the AU price list
// (RAW/11 Price List Australia ...xlsx) at all.
//
//  - JTP ("JetPen"): owner-requested new option, L-Series only. Distinct
//    from the pre-existing "JetPen" option (coded from the L-Series sheet's
//    own "Jetpen Marking Tool..." row, priced 7500) -- that row is untouched;
//    this is a second, separate, as-yet-unpriced option per explicit

//    service options below, this one deliberately has no US price either --
//    see scripts/extract-us-prices.ts, which does not map "JTP" to anything).

//  - SVC-*: service options for the new "SERVICE" container product (see
